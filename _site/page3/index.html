    <p>Now that we can be sure of having a <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Quick-Response-From-Baltimore-Chief-Data-Officer">complete data set</a> for the immediately preceding two years, we can take a closer look at parking citation policies and compliance.</p>

<p>Since the <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/sun-investigates/bs-md-speed-camera-hearing-20141201-story.html">traffic camera program ended in Baltimore in 2013</a> it appears enforcement policies have taken a dramatic turn to make up some of the lost revenue.  Moreover, judging by the spike this past December, I’d hazard a guess that either year-end budgets were looking tight or that goals or quotas had been set at the beginning of the year and were not being met.</p>

<h2 id="what-locations-are-they-targeting">What locations are they targeting?</h2>

<p>Between January 20, 2013 and January 20, 2015, citations were issued at 38,597 unique locations.  <strong>1.2% of those locations account for 45.8% of the total value of fines issued.</strong>  What were the target locations?  Here are the top 20 locations in terms of total fines issued.</p>

<h3 id="university-of-baltimore">University of Baltimore</h3>

<p>I would post a map, but I haven’t been able to confirm that “U/B” is University of Baltimore, especially since some of the street names aren’t near the university.  University students are prime candidates for parking tickets though, so it does make sense that so many citations are issued there.</p>

<h3 id="block-of-n-charles-st">1200 Block of N. Charles St.</h3>

<p>The 1200 block of N. Charles St. just happens to be the block I live on.  As soon as I discovered that, I had an inkling as to the reason why this would be the case and the data back this up.  This road turns into a major thoroughfare for commuters driving north out of downtown to head back to the ‘burbs, and as far as Charles St. goes this block is probably the block on which cars are most likely to be stopped and blocking traffic due to the number of businesses and close proximity of University of Baltimore.</p>

<p>There’s a Starbucks on one corner with a Chipotle next to it, immediately in front of which there is a bus stop.  In addition to the Starbucks and Chipotle, there are a number of other businesses (frozen yogurt, licquor store, other restaurants) that presumably all take deliveries at regular intervals.  On numerous occasions I’ve walked past and a large truck or semi is parked at the bus stop with a ticket on its windshield.  This would explain at least the “In Transit Zone/Stop,” but I do wonder at how consistent parking police are in their coding of citations.</p>

<p>Street parking immediately behind the bus stop shown below is prohibited weekdays between 4pm and 6pm, which the data show is another large revenue generator.   </p>

<p>It’s interesting that such a large number of fines are coded as “No Stopping/Parking Stadium Event Cambden”  since Cambden Yards isn’t nearby or even on Charles St.  Again, makes me wonder at how the parking police are trained to code the infractions.</p>

    <p>Within hours of publishing my last post on <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Baltimores-Lost-Traffic-Camera-Revenue/">Baltimore’s parking (etc.) citation dataset</a>, the issues were corrected thanks to Sharon Paley at <a href="http://www.hackbaltimore.org">Hack Baltimore</a> and Heather Hudson, Baltimore’s Chief Data Officer in the <a href="http://moit.baltimorecity.gov/Home.aspx">Mayor’s Office of Information Technology</a>.</p>

<p>Sharon was kind enough to forward my work on to Heather, who removed old and extraneous data and added some description to some of the citation data fields.  With Heather’s permission I’ve excerpted her email below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The dataset should, and now does, reflect 2 rolling years of citations and any older citations that still have an outstanding balance. The data was not being updated and purged consistently, resulting in older citations still appearing. These older citation records were likely not updated properly (balance, penalty, etc), so have now been purged from the dataset.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reason for the 2 year  limited time frame of the dataset is that the Parking Citations system is housed on a mainframe, which has storage limitations. We are also forced to re-use citation numbers, which necessitates purging of older citation records.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks to your article, I have added a more informative description of the dataset, as well as short descriptions of the currency columns you mentioned. I hope that this helps users better understand the data presented.</p>

<p>I exported another csv file the evening of January 21 that resulted in 1,004,288 rows (compared to about 2.7 million rows previously, meaning <strong>63% of the dataset was erroneous and discarded</strong>).  Total fines issued in the whole datset now amount to just over $48 million.  </p>

<h2 id="why-are-there-still-data-in-here-from-before-january-21-2013-2-years-before-the-date-i-downloaded-this-set">Why are there still data in here from before January 21, 2013 (2 years before the date I downloaded this set)?</h2>

<p>Well, you wouldn’t want to remove information about citations that haven’t been paid in full yet.  484,146 records (out of just over 1 million, or about half) are from before 2 years ago because they haven’t been paid in full.  I confirmed that there are zero records for which the import date is more than two years old and does not have an outstanding balance (if going by the violation date, there are 16 records as of Jan. 21, 2015 older than two years with a zero balance in the database).  </p>

<p>What this means is that we effectively have two datasets here: one for accounts with open balances from before the rolling 2 year date and one for all citations (regardless of balance) for the last 2 years rolling.  Lumping them all together wouldn’t yield apples-to-apples comparisons or indicate policy changes properly since we’re missing citation records that have been paid and were issued/imported more than two years ago.  We can however do this with the data for the most recent 2 years.  I suppose the pre-2-years ago data could be considered the “delinquent” batch and data for the most recent 2 years could be called the “full 2 year” batch.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-money-is-owed-to-the-city">How much money is owed to the city?</h2>

<p>This is the kicker.  Looking only at the old citations prior to January 21, 2013?  The outstanding balance is <strong>$102,384,876.00</strong>, and that’s on citations that would have originally been worth only $23,873,386.00.  In other words, for still-open tickets prior to January 21, 2013, the city is owed more than <strong>4 times the value</strong> of the initial citations.  Wonder if the city has a plan of attack for reeling some of this in?  The wages of parking police probably pale in comparsion to the value of these citations, so maybe they see this as free money that they’ll never make the effort to get, having already paid the overhead. Of course there are logistical and legal challenges to enforcing these as well, but this is surely money the city of Baltimore could use.</p>

<p>Thanks again to Sharon at Hack Baltimore and Heather, our city’s Chief Data Officer, for helping to keep our government’s open data clean, current and useful.</p>

    <p>The title of the dataset I’m working with on Baltimore’s <a href="http://data.baltimorecity.gov/">open data portal</a> is “Parking Citations.”  I downloaded a snapshot of the dataset which ended up being 2,689,647 total citations through January 12, 2015. </p>

<center>
<div><iframe width="500px" title="Parking Citations" height="425px" src="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/w/n4ma-fj3m/ta62-x9wp?cur=i5SwBTR0Hvd&amp;from=root" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Transportation/Parking-Citations/n4ma-fj3m" title="Parking Citations" target="_blank">Parking Citations</a></iframe><p><a href="http://www.socrata.com/" target="_blank">Powered by Socrata</a></p></div>
</center>

<p>But parking is not the only thing captured in this set. Traffic camera violations are also here (“Fixed Speed Cameras,” “Mobile Speed Cameras,” and probably some “Red Light Violations” and “Right on Red” citations) which were far and away the city’s largest revenue generator out of all of the infraction types captured here.  The fixed speed cameras alone issued nearly $28 million in citations over a three year period, until the <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/sun-investigates/bs-md-speed-camera-hearing-20141201-story.html">program was ended</a>.  The last two rows appear to be one-off citations.  It’s also curious that the last record of a “Snow Emergency Route Violation” was in August. In Baltimore.</p>

  <figcaption>Citation descriptions sorted by total fines.  Highlighted in red are the least recent dates of the last recorded citation and the shortest data time spans, respectively.  Highlighted in green are the largest annual revenue generators.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This all isn’t quite syncing up with what the <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/sun-investigates/bs-md-speed-camera-hearing-20141201-story.html">Baltimore Sun reported</a> about the traffic camera program.  According to this article, the traffic camera program generated about $140 million over 10 years.  The data contained in Baltimore’s open data portal must be incomplete, since I’m seeing a total of about $127 million for all violation types, not just cameras.  </p>

<p>To show this a bit more dramatically, here’s the time series of total monthly citations issued for the top 10 revenue generator categories.  It’s pretty clear that the data are incomplete since the traffic camera categories should have dominated for 10 years straight, and we’re seeing no significant records before 2007, even though the earliest start dates shown in the table above show dates typically starting in 2002-2003, with “Red Light Violations” starting in 1999.  Unfortunately, the Baltimore open data portal does not provide a data dictionary or substantive description of what all is contained in the dataset and what each field represents.  For example, in addition to “violFine,” there are “balance,” “openFine,” and “openPenalty” fields which all include “$” signs in the records to indicate currency.  These aren’t defined anywhere.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t say that the lack of definitions and descriptions of the data render them completely useless, but it does make it more difficult to make apples-to-apples comparisons and draw conclusions.</p>

    <p>I find myself importing a slew of comma-separated value (csv) files quite often so I wrote up a quick bit of code to handle it.  </p>

<p>It’s uber-simple - just loops through all the csv’s in a directory, appends them to one Pandas dataframe, and saves the new csv.  It also tacks on the filenames of each file if separating into the original files is needed later.  This also assumes all the fields are named exactly the same in all the csv files.  Sure beats reading each individually and merging after.</p>

    <p>By varying parameters of the <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Intro-To-Storage-Model">demand-side storage model</a> we can determine the economic plausibility and benefits of home grid-tied batteries.  </p>

<p>While the actual logic and functions are in separate Python modules, I’m doing this analysis in an <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jtelszasz/demandside_storage/blob/master/analysis.ipynb">iPython notebook</a> that you can check out for more detail and thought process.</p>

<p>I set up some of summary metrics I was interested in in the <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Storage-Model-Details">last post</a> .  One that I didn’t have on that list that is an important economic indicator is the simple payback period, which is the number of years it would take to break even on the initial investment based on the yearly savings.</p>

<center>
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?PBP=\frac{Initial%20Investment}{Annual%20Variable%20Cost%20Savings}" alt="PBP=\frac{Initial%20Investment}{Annual%20Variable%20Cost%20Savings}" />
</center>

<p>The summary metrics I’ve calculated should indicate the benefits of having a home battery system to the consumer/household as well as the grid (system operator and grid).  Of course, these are going to be particular to the load profile I’m using (Green Button sample data), but another one-year hourly load profile could easily be supplanted to see how it would work out for other buildings.  </p>

<h2 id="summary-metrics-v-storage-capacity">Summary Metrics v. Storage Capacity</h2>

<p>One question that can be asked of the model is how certain summary metrics vary with the total battery capacity.  For example, an increase in battery size would allow the building to purchase more of the cheaper electricity during off-peak hours increasing the annual savings, but the initial investment also increases.  </p>

<p>All of the other parameters are held constant, with battery and inverter efficiencies during charging and discharging all set to 0.85 (the “inverter_efficiency” and “battery_efficiency” below are function handles).  The charge rate estimate is assuming it take 8 hours to fully charge the battery.  I’ve estimated the cost of deep-discharge lead acid batteries as being about $166 per kilowatt-hour of storage (based on a quick Amazon.com search that dug up $200 for a 1.2 kWh battery).  The model currently isn’t sophisticated enough to vary the charge and discharge rates based on voltage and current as should be done, but this should suffice for a rough estimate.  For an initial estimate, I also have not factored in battery replacement to the payback period, though this should have a substantial effect and I’ll need to do this at some point.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jtelszasz/demandside_storage/blob/master/analysis.ipynb">analysis notebook</a> I create an array with all of the battery sizes, and loop through them each time setting the bat_size variable to the next size in the array.  Each time, the model creates the output over the entire year (all 8,760 hours) and then calculates the summary metrics.  The result is a dataframe of all the summary metrics indexed by summary size.</p>

</center>

<p>Now it’s easy to create some plots to illustrate how these metrics change with storage capacity.</p>

<h3 id="cost-savings-and-payback-period">Cost Savings and Payback Period</h3>

<p>The expectation is that there are diminishing returns, since there is a limited number of peak hours energy demand that can be supplied by electricity purchased during off-peak hours, while of course the amount of battery storage we can purchase is unlimited.  Based on this plot, the most storage we should purchase is 15 kWh worth.  The percent savings calculated is with respect to the default static BGE residential electricity prices, in other words what this home would have paid over the course of the year in electricity supplied (not including fixed tariffs and charges).</p>

  <figcaption>Annual cost savings for demand-side storage (home battery) system.</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

<p>In general, the payback periods are a bit longer than I thought they would be.  There’s a clear optimum solution at a storage capacity of 5 kWh with the payback period being about 14.5 years.  What’s really driving the cost effectiveness (I think) is the difference between the peak and off-peak cost of electricity.  A wider difference between these prices will make it more cost effective to purchase storage and electricity during off-peak hours.</p>

  <figcaption>Simple payback period for demand-side storage (home battery) system.</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

<h3 id="grid-benefits-load-shaving">Grid Benefits (Load Shaving)</h3>

<p>This pretty closely mirrors the cost savings, and understandably so since the costs are directly proportional to the amount of electricity being removed from peak-hours and purchased instead during off-peak hours.  At 15 kWh of storage we’ve just about maxed out the amount of peak time kilowatt-hours we can shave, which is all off the electricity demand for this house occuring during peak hours.  This is about 1800 kWh for this house’s load profile.</p>

  <figcaption>Peak load shaving for demand-side storage (home battery) system.</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

<h3 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h3>

<p>Since electricity purchased simultanesously with demand (not shifted using storage) doesn’t go through any other equipment, the system’s efficiency is effectively 100% since all the electricity purchased goes directly to the serve the demand.  However, electricity purchased during off-peak hours for use at a later time first goes through the inverter to become DC, then is stored in the battery (also lossy), and takes the opposite process on the way out.  That means that the quantity of kilowatt-hours purchased from the grid becomes higher as more electricity is bought and stored.  For this reason, the “efficiency” (the total annual kWh demand divided by the total kWh purchased from the grid) drops as storage size increases. </p>

  <figcaption>Total kWh purchased during year for demand-side storage (home battery) system.</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

<p>This is an important (albeit predictable) result since it means we’ve effectively increased the carbon footprint of the home, assuming the electricity mix is dominated by carbon-intensive power sources.  What such a system could allow for, however, is that intermittent renewable resources could more readily integrate with storage acting as a buffer between demand and intermittent supply.</p>

<p>This makes changes in hourly trends over the course of the year readily apparent, and even highlights differences day to day.  The 6am/7am peak is pretty clear, as are the evening hours in the summer.  Between midnight a 4am, the usage is clearly higher (deeper yellow) in the summer as well due to AC load.</p>

    <p>This post fills in some more details of the <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Intro-To-Storage-Model">demand-side storage model</a>.</p>

<p>In the last post I presented a flow chart of how the logic works but didn’t give a diagram of what the physical system might look like.  That’s below.</p>

<p>I’ve illustrated the switch as being a separate component so we can see that electricity could bypass actually being inverted and stored (electricity from the grid sometimes goes directly to the demand).  In reality, the inverter/switch/charge controller would be one system.  This unit and the batteries would be the initial costs for the system.</p>

<h2 id="model-parameters">Model Parameters</h2>

<p>For electricity going straight to serve demand (not being stored first), there are essentially no additonal losses.  However, batteries only accept DC electricity, so we need an inverter to turn the AC off the grid to DC and back.  There are losses associated with this conversion, and the batteries themselves are lossy.  For now I’ve set these efficiencies as constants, but implemented them in functions so they could in the future get more sophisticated modeling (charging efficiency for batteries is dependent on depth of charge).  The nominal efficiency values are taken from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Renewable-Efficient-Electric-Power-Systems/dp/0471280607/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412769771&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=renewable+and+efficient+electric+power+systems">Renewable and Efficient Electric Power Systems by Gilbert Masters</a>.</p>

<p>There are also several other system parameters that need to be initialized, including the size of the storage, costs, etc.  In future analyses these variables can be varied to assess the effects on costs and energy.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>Once the model has calculated all the energy flows for each hour over the course of the year, I calculate a set of key properties of the system behavior.  These results are shown in the table below.  These are the characteristics I’ll be interested in as the system parameters described above are varied (though I may modify this set).</p>

<ul>
  <li>’% Peak Demand Battery’: Percent of the total peak demand over the year served from the battery</li>
  <li>’% Peak kWh Shaved’: Percent of the total demand during peak hours removed from the grid</li>
  <li>’% Purchased During Off-Peak’: Percent of annual electricity purchased during off-peak hours</li>
  <li>’% Purchased During Peak’: Percent of annual electricity purchased during peak hours</li>
  <li>‘Annual System Eff’: Total annual demand divided by total annual electricity purchased</li>
  <li>‘Annual Var Cost’: Annual electricity cost</li>
  <li>‘Hours Battery Depleted’: Number of hours in the year that battery is drained to maximum depth of discharge</li>
  <li>‘Hours Battery Full’: Number of hours in the year that battery is fully charged</li>
  <li>‘Hours on Battery Only’: Number of hours in the year that demand is served by battery alone</li>
  <li>‘Initial Cost’: Initial system cost (inverter + batteries)</li>
  <li>‘Peak kWh Shaved’: Total electricity during peak hours removed from the grid</li>
  <li>‘Total kWh Purchased’: Total annual electricity purchased</li>
</ul>

<p>Below are some initial values from the simulation with a storage size of 9 kWh.</p>

<p>For these initial values, what stood out to me was that I removed 54% of the residence’s annual peak demand from the grid (this is the ‘% Peak kWh Shaved’).  This is the reason utilities might want to think about incentivizing residential customers to purchase grid-tied battery systems such as this (beyond just the time-of-use-pricing incentive itself).  I should say that the current model is agnostic to exactly which peak hours load is being shaved from - it just uses the battery first until it’s depleted and then switches to grid during peak hours.  Utilities would want to be a bit more sensitive to this, since their peak time-of-use currently starts at 10am weekdays in the summer but the actual “peak” won’t hit until around 4pm.  In the current model I’ve created, the battery is used up first so I wouldn’t be shaving peak load at 4pm.  This could be addressed with some logic that is a bit more clever than what I’ve currently got.</p>

    <p>Buying lead-acid batteries and switching to one of <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/BGE-Pricing">BGE’s time-of-use pricing plans</a> may be a very good idea indeed.</p>

<p>BGE (and many other utilities in the U.S.) are now offering a time-of-use pricing plan in which the price you pay for electricity depends on what time of day or season you are purchasing it.  This is one of the so-called “demand-side strategies” that could help utilities reduce peak loads and prevent blackouts.  In a <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Should-I-Switch-To-TOU-Pricing">previous post</a>, I looked at whether it would make financial sense for me to switch over to one of these plans.</p>

<p>One can imagine taking further advantage of these plans by purchasing most or all electricity during off-peak (cheap) hours without having to buy much or any during peak hours.  In order to explore how this might work and how beneficial it would be, I built a model in Python that simulates the hourly energy flows for a home with lead-acid battery storage.</p>

<p>There are two sources of data that drive the model.  First, I’ve used one of the <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Feeding-The-Data-Monster">Green Button sample data files</a>, specifically the one for an inland, single-family residence.  This is an hourly electricity demand profile for the whole residential building for all of 2011.  Second, I’ve again used <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/BGE-Pricing">BGE’s time-of-use pricing schemes</a> to determine peak hours and costs.  Some of the ideas are based on <a href="http://sel.columbia.edu/matlab-assignment-1">a Matlab assignment I worked on in grad school</a>.  While I no longer have access to the top tier journals (Elsevier is a capitalist racket), I did find a couple papers <a href="https://www.thlab.net/wp-content/uploads/publications/pub_19.pdf">here</a> and <a href="http://www.ecs.umass.edu/~irwin/smartcharge.pdf">here</a> that are using similar algorithms.</p>

<p>I’ve drawn out a flow chart to show how the model works.  During off-peak times, the demand is served directly from the grid and if the battery isn’t full, extra energy is purchased to charge the battery (there is a maximum rate at which this can occur).  During peak times, energy is first used out of the battery to serve the demand.  Only when the battery is drained (to an acceptable charge level, say 30%) is energy then purchased from the grid to serve demand directly.  No energy is purchased to charge the battery during peak hours.</p>

<p>If seeing the logic implemented in code would help, it’s below.  I’m not going to put all those functions below as well, needless to say they assign the proper values at each hour.  You could also get them from me on <a href="https://github.com/jtelszasz/demandside_storage">Github</a>.</p>

<p>In the plot below, I’ve shown the behavior of the system for a typical summer day.  Peak hours are shaded.  As you can see, during off-peak hours additional energy is purchased in order to recharge the battery.  During peak hours, the battery is discharged preferentially before purchasing any peak-hour electricity in order to minimize cost.</p>

  <figcaption>Model behavior for summer weekday, with peak period shaded in gray.</figcaption>

<p>In the above plot there are two energy flows from the grid - one going to serve demand directly and the other to storage.  (There are actually three shown since I separate peak from off-peak, but you get the idea.)  To make a bit clearer how much energy is being purchased at each hour, I’ve summed those two quanities and plotted below.  Clearly in the off-peak hours, a bit extra is being purchased to charge the batteries.  During the first part of the peak period, nothing has to be purchased from the grid since the battery is serving the demand.  Once that is depleted, energy has to be purchased during the remainder of the peak period.</p>

  <figcaption>Amount of energy purchased in storage model, with peak period shaded in gray.</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

<p>It’s important to remember that the actual quantity of killowatt-hours of electricity purchased over the course of the year isn’t different than without storage, it’s just being purchased from the grid at different hours.  The consumer doesn’t need to modify their gluttonous behavior in order to make this work.  The benefit to the consumer is saving money, and the benefit to the utility is shaving peak loads.  </p>

<p>A bunch of questions are already popping up in my head:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the payback period for the battery system?</li>
  <li>How do the size of the battery and the peak-off-peak cost differential affect the payback period?</li>
  <li>What percent of hours/energy over the course of the year come through the storage system as opposed to directly from grid?</li>
  <li>How much storage is needed so that peak hour electricity is never purchased and how much does this cost?  What is the payback period?</li>
  <li>How does the cost of the system change with percent of peak-hour demand served by storage?</li>
</ul>

    <p>It’s been a bit.  Work got busy, I got stalled and needed an IDE, and I developed a new model.</p>

<p>I didn’t have much time over the summer for this stuff.  My real job got pretty busy.  You don’t care about that though.</p>

<p>I did get a bit stalled.  As I’ve discussed previously, I’ve used iPython notebooks <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/the-work">quite a bit</a> for conducting analyses.  These only got me so far.  I’ve been working on a demand-side storage model to figure out how to take advantage of time-of-use pricing now available from utility companies.  While the notebooks work great for documenting analyses and creating plots, building a model is nearly impossible with them.  They aren’t really useful if you need multiple functions and scripts.  I was encountering bugs early on in building the model and couldn’t fix them.  It was frustrating.</p>

<p>This type of scientific computing really calls for an integrated development environment, or IDE.  It’s the one thing I’ve been missing since starting in with Python in lieu of Matlab.  An IDE gives you an interactive console, debugging capabilities, and an editor all in one program.  After reading a bit online, it seemed the two big ones for Python were <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> and <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm">Pycharm</a>.  I started with Eclipse.  I couldn’t for the life of me get it working, something about the external libraries I was using wasn’t getting set up right.  I tried every way imaginable, but this was as frustrating as the original bugs in my code.  I switched to Pycharm, and pretty quickly was up and running.</p>

<p>Long story short, with an IDE in hand I found my bugs pretty quickly and finished building the model over a weekend.  I definitely recommend Pycharm or another IDE (even trying Eclipse, if you can get it working) for anything more complicated than simple models or exploratory data analysis.  You could even write all your functions and scripts for a model in an IDE and then switch to notebooks for analysis and results of the model.</p>
