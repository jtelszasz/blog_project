    <p>A quick blurb on a couple of pieces of the demand-side storage puzzle I’m working on.</p>

<p>First, turns out I’m going to use the Green Button sample data that I <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/feeding-the-data-monster">previously found</a>.  They have <a href="http://services.greenbuttondata.org/sample-data.html">several of these datasets posted</a> that may be interesting for comparison later.  It took an embarassing amount of time to sort out my first time parsing an XML file.  Word of advice for you data/Python peoples: don’t use ElementTree, I used BeautifulSoup and it was much simpler.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/Green_Button_Sample_Inland_Single_Family_Daily.png"><img src="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/Green_Button_Sample_Inland_Single_Family_Daily.png" /></a>
  <figcaption>Green Button sample hourly data for inland single family residence, resampled to daily.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Definitely nice to have a full year worth of clean data.  You can also clearly see the bump up in summer usage from A/C loads.</p>

<p>In sorting out the demand-side storage question, I also took a look at what pricing schemes BGE has on offer.  They currently have the normal <a href="http://www.bge.com/myaccount/billsrates/ratestariffs/electricservice/Electric%20Services%20Rates%20and%20Tariffs/P3_SCH_R.pdf">residential plan (“R”)</a>, a <a href="http://www.bge.com/myaccount/billsrates/ratestariffs/electricservice/Electric%20Services%20Rates%20and%20Tariffs/P3_SCH_RL.pdf">residential time-of-use, or TOU, plan (“RL”)</a>, and a <a href="http://www.bge.com/myaccount/billsrates/ratestariffs/electricservice/Electric%20Services%20Rates%20and%20Tariffs/ScheduleEV.pdf">plan for electric vehicle customers (“EV”)</a>.  All of the actual costs for peak, off-peak, and intermediate are found <a href="http://www.bge.com/myaccount/billsrates/ratestariffs/electricservice/Electric%20Services%20Rates%20and%20Tariffs/Rdr_1.pdf">here</a>.  Obviously, there are a proverbial shit-ton of other nickel-and-dime tariffs, but since they’re paid per kilowatt-hour and aren’t tied to the actual price of electricity itself.  I’m assuming for the sake of comparison that the total number of kilowatt-hours you use is independent of the pricing plan you have. </p>

<p>Here’s what the three pricing plans look like for weekdays in summer and non-summer periods.</p>

    <p>Here’s a quick comparison of average weekdays and weekends in the new and old apartments.</p>

<p>It would appear that we’ve been using more at the new place, but take a look at the daily totals. </p>

<figure>
  <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/Average_Days_New_and_Old_Apts.png"><img src="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/Average_Days_New_and_Old_Apts.png" /></a>
  <figcaption>Average hourly electric usage for new and old apartments, March and June.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Of course we don’t have apples-to-apples comparisons here.  Of course this is partly due to weather.  The old apartment is shown for March, where we left the thermostat on all day at 65 degrees F so Willow The Cat wouldn’t freeze to death.  At the new apartment, we’re shutting off the thermostat entirely during the day, and at night kicking it on to 75 degrees F.  So for weekdays, we’re consuming much less during the day but evenings are much higher.  </p>

<p>However, the <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Guess-What-Time-Justin-Wakes-Up">6am peak when we wake up</a> is also much higher.  I’m sure that this is due to our own dedicated electric water heater at the new place.  Our two showers in the morning plus lighting loads are the 6am peak, while the evening hours are the A/C and any dishwashing we’re doing after dinner.</p>

<p>To do these average day plots I set up a quick function that uses groupby, that way I can reuse this for any time period.</p>

    <p>Steph and I moved on May 23.  </p>

<p>I didn’t manage to grab the data for the last three weeks of May before changing apartments (and therefore BGE accounts), so I missed out on those three weeks of data.  However, we’ve now been there just over two months and so we’ve got some A/C load data to work with.</p>

<p>The differences in the data are pretty staggering.  One issue is that we moved at the beginning of summer so our previous apartment with electric resistance heating has all the heating loads and the new apartment with central A/C has all the cooling loads.  The rest of the differences are described below.</p>

<h3 id="physical-differences-in-apartments">Physical Differences in Apartments</h3>

<p>Our old and new apartments are less than half a mile apart on the same street that runs north and south (St. Paul Street in Baltimore).  There are some important differences of note between the two apartments.</p>

<p><strong>Size</strong>. The new apartment is much larger in floor area, and has ceilings that appear even higher (though I didn’t take measurements at the old apartment).  In addition to large living room and bedroom, the new apartment has two bathrooms, a much larger kitchen and attached dining space, and a large foyer.</p>

<p><strong>Building Envelope and Fenestration</strong>. The building itself is still row style, so our exterior exposure is limited to the front of the building and the back.  The old apartment only had exposure in the rear to a fire escape corridor down the center of the building, not to the very rear of the building.  Our new apartment has practically floor to ceiling windows in the front and back.  The new apartment windows are less than 10 years old, where the windows from the last apartment were original single pane and were considerably drafty.</p>

<p><strong>Space Heating</strong>.  Space heating at the old apartment was provided by electric resistance heating in two zones (living room and bedroom) from ductless split A/C units (the A/C compressor failed on the living room zone).  This means that the electricity data I’ve been using for the old apartment include heating loads.  The new apartment has an <a href="http://www.commercial.carrier.com/commercial/hvac/product_technical_literature/1,3069,CLI1_DIV41_ETI4922_PRD694,00.html">80,000 Btu/h input natural gas-fired central furnace</a>.  We’re lucky enough that it’s a condensing furnace (efficient enough that flue gases cool below their condensing point) with an AFUE of 92.1%. The new data will not include heating loads since this is gas-fired, and the only information we’d have on gas use would be monthly.  We moved in at the end of May so there haven’t been any heating loads yet.  </p>

<p><strong>Space Cooling</strong>.  The compressor for the ductless split A/C in the living room failed, and they were cheapskates and replaced it with a window unit.  An 11,000 Btu/h output unit for a family room and kitchen with high ceilings and drafty single pane windows.  In the new apartment, we have central A/C. (<a href="http://www.commercial.carrier.com/wcs/proddesc_display/0,2733,CLI1_DIV41_ETI4926_NBD_PRD1311,00.html">This</a> is the evaporator coil, I haven’t looked closely at the compressor outside yet.)  In both cases, we shut the A/C off during the day, and generally set the thermostat to 75 degrees Fahrenheit when we’re home in evenings and on weekends.</p>

<p><strong>Water Heating</strong>. In our previous apartment, hot water was included.  In the new apartment, we have a dedicated <a href="http://products.geappliances.com/ApplProducts/Dispatcher?REQUEST=SpecPage&amp;Sku=GE38S06AAG">38-gallon electric water heater</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Lighting</strong>. There are many more light fixtures in the new apartment, though the vast majority use compact florescents. The former living room had only the light (incandescents) from a ceiling fan, while the new living room has 6 recessed lights and a ceiling fan light.  Additionally, there’s a ceiling fan with chandelier in the foyer, 5 recessed ceiling lights in the kitchen and dining room, along with halogen lighting underneath the cabintery in the kitchen.</p>

<p><strong>Appliances</strong>.  The previous aparment had only the basics - a refrigerator, microwave (ours, and small), and gas oven range. Our new apartment additionally has a dishwasher and in-aparment laundry washer and dryer.</p>

<p><strong>Usage</strong>.  Generally, our schedules haven’t really changed.  Like I mentioned previously, we shut the A/C off during the day, and only really use it in the evenings (after 7pm or so) and on weekends and only set it to 75 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

    <p>Scouring the internetz for some data.</p>

<p>There are a few research questions that I’d like to dig into but I haven’t quite found the right data yet for them.  Ideally I would use our apartment data, but I need at least some summer data (early June won’t count) and we actually just moved apartments.  There are some important differences between the previous and current apartment - namely central AC, larger but less leaky windows, a much larger floor plan, a dishwasher, and a dedicated apartment electric water heater.  </p>

<p>I’ve done some digging to come up with some other candidate datasets, though this is by no means comprehensive.  I’m mainly looking for at least a year worth of hourly electricity data (or finer scale that could be resampled) for a household or apartment with moderate or high summer air conditioning loads. A lot of the publicly available electricity usage datasets I’ve found have been geared toward non-invasive appliance load monitoring (NIALM) research - test data for algorithms that can breakout appliance end uses based on the electricity signatures.  Generally these are very high frequency (sub-minute time scales) but cover much shorter spans than needed (really a full year).  Hopefully this compilation is useful for other researchers out there.</p>

<p>I think I might also put some of these in an appropriate Github folder and turn this post into a readme for future use.  There are plenty more out there that are geared towards the NIALM stuff so if I get into that more, I can add it to the list there.</p>

<h3 id="green-button-sample-datasets">Green Button Sample Datasets</h3>

<p>Since BGE has signed on to use the Green Button data standard (like most utilities using smart meters have) I’m hoping to use a sample dataset, since it would easily be replaced by my own data once it’s available.</p>

<p>The National Institute for Standards and Technology has a <a href="https://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-sggrid/bin/view/SmartGrid/GreenButtonSDK">list of available sample datasets on their website</a> for the software development kit, or SDK.  It isn’t specified what type of building or location the samples are from, but they do provide hourly profiles that add up to a full year’s worth of data.  This may be worth digging into.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-sggrid/bin/view/SmartGrid/GreenButtonSDK">same NIST website</a> links to some data from San Diego Gas and Electric (SDGE).  There are multiple hourly datasets listed, and they specify a region within SDGE’s territory that the data have come from (coastal, inland, desert, etc.)</p>

<p>I also found <a href="http://www.sdge.com/documents/green-button-60-min-meter-interval-sample-data-csv">this</a> sample on SDGE’s own website.  It’s one year worth of hourly interval electrcity usage data for a residence.  At least looking at this one dataset qualitatively, the A/C loads don’t peak nearly as badly as I’d expect in Baltimore during the summer so I probably won’t use this.</p>

<h3 id="pecan-street-research-institute">Pecan Street Research Institute</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.pecanstreet.org">Pecan Street Research Institute</a> curates possibly the largest residential energy and water consumption dataset.  The effort was initiated in 2009 and monitors the electricity, gas, and water use of over 900 homes in Texas at 1-minute resolution.  The electricity monitoring includes both whole house and up to 23 submetered circuits.  Unfortunately you have to be an active academic researcher to even obtain a free sample of the dataset, let alone full access to the whole shebang.</p>

<h3 id="jack-kelly-phd-student-at-imperial-college">Jack Kelly, PhD student at Imperial College</h3>

<p>Jack Kelly at Imperial College has been gracious enough to post his home monitoring datasets on <a href="https://www.github.com/jackkelly">Github</a>.  He’s been monitoring two homes for electricity usage and sub-minute timescales, neither of which include air-conditioning data.  The lack of air conditioning doesn’t really help me.</p>

<h3 id="kaggle-competition-sample-data">Kaggle Competition Sample Data</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.kaggle.com">Kaggle</a> hosts a platform for open competitions that usually ask competitors to devise machine learning or statistical predicitions, the most accurate prediction winning.  Several of the competitions have involved energy - either forecasting demand or disaggregating demand data into end uses (Kaggle’s actual business involves the application of machine learning for the energy industry).  The <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/belkin-energy-disaggregation-competition">disaggregation competition, sponsored by Belkin</a>, asked competitors to try and make use of a particular technique in order to tease out how much energy was used for various appliances.  The data used for this is very high frequency resolution for four houses.</p>

<h3 id="uci-center-for-machine-learning-and-intelligent-systems">UCI Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems</h3>

<p>University of California at Irvine has a center in the computer science department that has sourced a <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption">dataset from researchers in Clamart, France</a>.  It appears the minute-resolution, sub-metered data (more than 2 million rows) were recorded by Georges Hebrail et al. for a home in France, but I haven’t been able to find traceback information to confirm.  Unfortunately, while one of the three submeters supposedly captures a water heater and an air conditioner, it’s clear that household member behavior - particularly when it comes to air conditioning - is substantially different than ours.  (This is likely the result of higher energy prices driving reduced consumption, something Americans are only familiar with when gasoline prices jump.)  Since I know our electricity consumption will spike significantly higher this summer, I don’t think this will be a useful dataset.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>NOTE: In the <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Predicting-Energy-Use-with-Support-Vector-Machines">previous post</a> I trained a support vector machine model using electricity demand data.  I should state that this is not the end of the analysis nor a robust model ready for release into the wild.  The model would need to undergo cross-validation to forge it into something more robust and generalized.</p>

<p>The data I’m using are the hourly electricity consumption in my apartment between January 18 and March 31, 2014, measured by a smart meter and provided by BGE. The following plot is a closer look at the predicted demand and actual demand over two days from the testing period.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/SVM_predict_TS_zoom.png"><img src="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/SVM_predict_TS_zoom.png" /></a>
  <figcaption>Predicted (SVR, next-hour) and actual hourly electricity usage, March 25 and 26.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It looks like, with some exceptions, the prediction is generally one hour behind what the actual electricity demand is doing, especially looking at most of the peaks.  At first I thought (hoped) that this was an issue with how I was date indexing the predicted values after calculating them (assigning a timestamp one hour behind what it should have been). But after closer inspection and thinking about it, this actually makes sense.  In the post on <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Autocorrelation">autocorrelation</a> I showed the following lag plot: </p>

<figure>
  <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/Elec_Lag_1hour.png"><img src="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/Elec_Lag_1hour.png" /></a>
  <figcaption>Lag plot, 1 hour.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The slope of the linear fit is about 0.97 and the constant (y-intercept) is about 0.04.  In other words, the ratio between any hour’s electricity demand and the hour previous is about one.  So unless the time of day or workday-non-workday indicator is <em>very</em> influential at any hour (like <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Guess-What-Time-Justin-Wakes-Up">6am</a>), the model will likely just predict the next hour to be the same as the current hour demand.  This will result in missing peaks by an hour, which if you’re a utility trying to schedule enough generation in the summer to meet the next hour’s air conditioning loads in a city, this is not so bueno.  I think the reason this is a product of the model is that a large fraction of the training samples used to build the model are <em>not</em> peaks, save for the <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Guess-What-Time-Justin-Wakes-Up">6am wake-up time</a>. </p>

<p>Below are the same results, just resampled to daily instead of hourly.</p>

<h3 id="accuracy-measures">Accuracy Measures</h3>

<p>In order to compare the accuracy of any models, the following measures can be used.  The file <a href="http://www.github.com/jtelszasz/my_energy/forecasts/">“errors.py”</a> has all of these functions for future use.</p>

<p>I’ve calculated and reported the values below and while some do have some absolute meaning, we’ll need to test out some more models to see the relative performance of the model.</p>

<h4 id="root-mean-sqaure-error">Root Mean Sqaure Error</h4>

<p>This is effectively the standard error of the model, and is in the same units as those of the predicted variable (or kilowatt-hours here).</p>

<p><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?RMSE=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{1}^{N}(y-\hat{y})^{2}}{N}}" title="RMSE=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{1}^{N}(y-\bar{y})^{2}}{N}}" /></p>

<p>The standard error for the <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Predicting-Energy-Use-with-Support-Vector-Machines">initial SVM model</a> is 0.17 kilowatt-hours.</p>

<h4 id="mean-absolute-percent-error">Mean Absolute Percent Error</h4>

<p>With this measure, the absolute percent error between each predicted value and actual value is calculated and the average is taken; the unit of measure is a percentage. If the absolute value wasn’t taken and there was little bias in the model, you’d end up with something close to zero and the measure would be worthless.  (No I couldn’t get the damn absolute value brackets working in the equation editor and I stopped caring.)</p>

<p><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?MAPE=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{1}^{N}\frac{abs(y-\hat{y})}{y}" title="MAPE=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{1}^{N}\frac{abs(y-\hat{y})}{y}" /></p>

<p>The mean absolute percent error for the SVM model is 19%.</p>

<h4 id="coefficient-of-variation">Coefficient of Variation</h4>

<p>This is similar to the RMSE measure, except it is normalized to the mean.  It indicates how much variation there is with respect to the mean.</p>

<p><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?CV=\sqrt{\frac{\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{1}^{N}(y-\hat{y})^{2}}{\bar{y}}}" title="CV=\sqrt{\frac{\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{1}^{N}(y-\hat{y})^{2}}{\bar{y}}}" /></p>

<p>The coefficient of variation for the SVM model is 0.21.</p>

<h4 id="mean-bias-error">Mean Bias Error</h4>

<p>The mean bias error gives an indication of how the model over- or underestimates.</p>

<p><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?MBE=\frac{\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{1}^{N}(y-\hat{y})}{\bar{y}}" title="MBE=\frac{\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{1}^{N}(y-\hat{y})}{\bar{y}}" /></p>

<p>The mean bias error for the initial SVM model is -0.02, which indicates the model isn’t systematically over- or underestimating the hourly kilowatt-hour consumption.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>As part of my research in grad school I had started getting interested in the use of machine learning tools for predicting energy consumption.  I went so far as to enroll in a machine learning class, but lacking the some of the statistical/mathematical knowledge for what they were teaching I ended up dropping about three-quarters of the way through.  I’ve since gone back on my own time and learned more statisical inference through online coursework, and am taking a stab at some analysis and coding.</p>

<h3 id="i-thought-we-had-a-model">I Thought We Had a Model</h3>

<p>In <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Energy-Use-and-Weather/">another post</a> I plotted electricity consumption against outdoor temperature and fit a straight line to the data.  </p>

<figure>
  <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/Elec_and_Temp_OLS.png"><img src="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/Elec_and_Temp_OLS.png" /></a>
  <figcaption>Linear ordinary least squares regression model for electricity consumption using outdoor temperature.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Let’s be honest: in terms of predictive capacity, this model sucks.  What if I needed to predict what the electricity consumption would be in the next hour?  The prediction would be on the line - I measure what the outdoor temperature is and read off the corresponding consumption from the blue line.  But look at how far the actual usage is scattered.  Unless I got very lucky, I’d be way off.  (In fact, I think using Bayesian regression I could quantify that probability, but that’s for another post.)</p>

<p>Clearly the linear assumption doesn’t tell the whole story.  It doesn’t capture other aspects of the weather (wind and sun) and especially human behavior that all influence the amount of electricity consumed.  </p>

<h3 id="enter-machine-learning">Enter Machine Learning</h3>

<p>Certainly there are other simpler modeling approaches I can take, and I’d like to learn more about those as well.  But because Python and Scikit-learn have made it so easy and intuitive, I jumped straight into the deep end with support vector machines.  Support vector machines find an <em>optimal</em> regression or classification model, minimizing both the error on the training data while minimizing the complexity of the model itself so that it will be generalized for new data (prediction).</p>

<p>Support vector machines can be used for classification or regression.  As with other machine learning algorithms, the model is first “trained” using a (hopefully large) dataset.  The model parameters are optimized until a balance is struck between errors and model simplicity, a balance that is user adjusted.</p>

<p>I should also say very clearly that I’m not breaking any new ground here, in fact <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~leparker/publications/Energy-Buildings-2012.pdf">this paper</a> compares several algorithms on similar household energy demand data sets to what I’m using (sensor-based time series) and using similar inputs (weather variables, hour of day, workday/holiday indicator).</p>

<h3 id="modeling">Modeling</h3>

<p>Based on some of the <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Autocorrelation">previous explorations of the data</a>, it looked like one hour’s electricity usage could be a very good predictor of the next hour’s usage.  In fact, it looked like it was a much better indicator than the <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Energy-Use-and-Weather">outdoor temperature</a>.  I wonder how far that alone will get us.</p>

<p>Well, not completely alone.  There are two other easy time-related variables I’d like to include.  One is the hour of the day (1 through 24, though these each need a feature unto themselves to make each hour equal to a categorical 0 or 1) and a field for whether or not the day was a typical work day or not (“not” would include holidays, weekends, and days I worked from home).  I would expect there to be a pattern of electricity usage associated with both of these variables and we can include them at virtually no modeling expense.</p>

  <figcaption>The training set.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As a training set, I’m using the hourly data between January 18 and March 24.  The testing set will consist of March 25 through March 31.</p>

<h3 id="support-vector-regression-with-scikit-learn">Support Vector Regression with Scikit-learn</h3>

<p>The Scikit-learn package for Python makes using machine learning algorithms simple and clean.  There is even a preprocessing module that does the scaling/normalization that should be done before building a model.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="python"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">sklearn</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">preprocessing</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">pre</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Then to actually train the support vector regression model, I simply call the <em>fit</em> function of the SVR class using the training data-target pairs.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="python"><span class="n">SVR_model</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">svm</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">SVR</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">kernel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;rbf&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">C</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">gamma</span><span class="o">=.</span><span class="mo">001</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">X_train_scaled</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">y_train</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The kernel <em>rbf</em> is a radial basis function.  This kernel transforms the data into a higher dimensional space when performing the regression.  This generally results in more robust modelling of nonlinearities.  The <em>C</em> and <em>gamma</em> parameters are the user-adjustments I alluded to earlier that allow the model to strike a balance between tightly fitting the training data while keeping the simplest model possible.  For this first test case, I just manually adjusted them by order of magnitude until the <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R^2" alt="R^2" />  I was getting over the test set was as high as possible.  A better approach would be to do a proper cross-validation that finds the best parameters for the these data.</p>

<p>Now to generate the prediction over the test data, I just call the <em>predict</em> function on the <em>SVM_model</em> object that I created (the trained model).</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="python"><span class="n">predict_y_array</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">SVR_model</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">predict</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">X_test_scaled</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since I know what the actual hourly usage was over the testing period, I can calculate an <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R^2" alt="R^2" /> for this testing set, which results in 0.732.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="python"><span class="n">SVR_model</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">score</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">X_test_scaled</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">y_test</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

  <figcaption>Predicted (SVR, next-hour) and actual hourly electricity usage.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It’s important to remember that this entire timespan wasn’t calculated in one go - each hour’s actual usage would have been used to help predict the next hour’s.  We’re always forecasting the next hour consumption in this scenario.</p>

<p>One way to visualize the accuracy of the predictions is to plot them against the actual values.  If the predictions were 100% accurate, all the points would lie on the 45 degree line shown in black.  It’s a good sign that the points are distributed rather evenly above and below the line; it suggests that there is little bias (systematic under- or over-estimating).  In another post I’ll dig in a little more on evaluating the model.</p>

<p>If the goal is to predict the next hour’s electricity consumption, a good predictor might be the consumption of the hour (or several hours) immediately prior.  One way to assess whether or not this is through the autocorrelation given by:</p>

<p><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_{h}=\frac{c_{h}}{c_{0}}=\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{N-h}(Y_{t}-\bar{Y})(Y_{t+h}-\bar{Y})}{\sum_{t=1}^{N}(Y_{t}-\bar{Y})^2}  " alt="R_{h}=\frac{c_{h}}{c_{0}}=\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{N-h}(Y_{t}-\bar{Y})(Y_{t+h}-\bar{Y})}{\sum_{t=1}^{N}(Y_{t}-\bar{Y})^2}" /></p>

<p>This measures the covariance between every point and a particular lag (or number of hours before) with respect to the overall variance.  This is calculated for every possible lag (for 1 hour all the way up to the length of the dataset) and plotted.  If the data were completely random, this would be zero at all time lags.  Again, I’m using the BGE smart meter data for my apartment for January 18 through March 31 of 2014.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/Elec_Autocorrelation.png"><img src="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/Elec_Autocorrelation.png" /></a>
  <figcaption>Electricity consumption autocorrelation.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Confidence intervals of 95% and 99% are also plotted (solid and dashed horizontal lines, respectively) and so points outside these intervals are statistically significant; that is, the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between the data and its a particular lag is rejected.  For the apartment’s electricity data there is statistically significant from 1 hour lag to approximately 500 hours of lag - the previous 20 days of electricity use are correlated with a typical hour’s elecricity use.</p>

<p>There also appears to be a significant inverse relationship with lag times longer than 600 hours (25 days).  My guess is that this is due to the warming weather between February and March.  This relationship indicates that the electricity consumption for a given hour is typically less than in February - something common sense tells us, but this says that relationship is statistically significant.</p>

<p>If we want to use history as a means for predicting the next hour of consumption, including the entire history would become unwieldy.  To train  model we’d be using an N x N array for training where N is the number of hours for which we’ve been recording data.  For predicting the next hour, we would need a 1 X N vector of all of the N previous hours.  Instead, it would be more computationally efficient if we could reduce the training data set to N x A where A is a small number of strongly correlated indicator hours, say the past 6 hours or so.  To get at this, I’ve plotted a few example lags against the hour’s electricity consumption.  There’s nothing to say that these relationships <em>must</em> be linear, but by plotting the scatter plot and checking the R^2 of the linear fit, it’s clear that for the most part the relationship (at least with immediate history) is linear.</p>

<figure class="half">
  <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/Elec_Lag_1hour.png"><img src="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/Elec_Lag_1hour.png" /></a>

  <figcaption>Lag plot and linear regression, 1 hour and 6 hour lag.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>Lag plot and linear regression, 12 hour and 24 hour lag.</figcaption>

As expected, as the size of the lag increases, the R^2 decreases, meaning the consumption 1 hour before is more relevant than the consumption 24 hours (or more) immediately prior.  If we want to build a predictive model, including the 1 hour lag would be wise.

<p>Stepping back, let’s take a look at what the actual time series of the smart meter electricity data looks like for my apartment.  I’ll also bring in the hourly outdoor temperature as measured at Baltimore-Washington International Airport (less than 10 miles away as the crow flies).  The data are obtained via the API at <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api">Weather Underground</a>.  Again, you can follow along my line (curve, circle, some other obscure geometry) of thinking by taking a look at the <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jtelszasz/my_energy/blob/master/My_Energy_And_Weather.ipynb?create=1">iPython notebook</a>.</p>

<figure>

  <figcaption>Time series of hourly electricity consumption and outdoor temperature.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It looks as if there’s an inverse relationship between the outdoor temperature and the apartment’s electricity consumption.  We’d expect this even in the winter for our apartment due to our use of electric resistance heating.  (This is a minority case as many buildings, whether commercial, multi-family, or single-family residential, burn fossil fuels directly for providing heat.  As a precursor to a potential future analysis I’d like to work on using these data, there’s often a debate whether the GHG emissions resulting from electric resistance heating are in fact on par or greater with burning natural gas directly in a furnace on site.  This is due to losses in the electric grid - first the combustion and thermal efficiency of the generation plant itself, then the various lossy inverters required for changing voltages and losses in the transmission lines themselves.  While this is an important question to ask, the broader picture and motivation should be the integration of renewables and storage to provide heat cleanly - electric resistance allows for this integration.)</p>

<p>Back to the temperature vs. electricity use question.  To start digging into the relationship a bit, we’ll start with the scatter plot.</p>

  <figcaption>Scatter plot of hourly electricity consumption and outdoor temperature.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As we’d expect, as the outdoor temperature increases, the electricity use generally decreases.  </p>

<h3 id="statistical-model">Statistical Model</h3>

<p>To take a first crack at quantifying the relationship we can use an ordinary least squares regression to try and quantify that relationship.  As is typically the case with Python, someone has already coded the tools necessary so I just have to import the Statsmodels module and use the right tool.</p>

<p>Running the following block of code…</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="python"><span class="n">model</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sm</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">OLS</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">elec_and_weather</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;USAGE&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="n">sm</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">add_constant</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">elec_and_weather</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;tempF&#39;</span><span class="p">]))</span>

<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">res</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">summary</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>…fits the model to our data and spits out the information about the model.</p>

<p>This is what the model actually looks like on top of the data.</p>

  <figcaption>Linear ordinary least squares regression model for electricity consumption using outdoor temperature.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So our R^2 shows that 48% of the variation in the electricity use can be explained by the outdoor temperature alone.  The remaining 52% would have to be explained by other variables or natural variability.</p>

<h3 id="engineering-model">Engineering Model</h3>

<p>What are we saying by assuming that the model should be linear?  That (all else being equal) for every degree increase in the outdoor temperature, there should be a proportional decrease in the electricity consumption.  There’s a reason this is a valid assumption, again negelecting the otherwise stochastic behavior as a result of weather and occupancy/behavior.  The underlying heat transfer equation is:</p>

<p><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q = hA \Delta T" alt="Q = hA \Delta T" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>where <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline Q" alt="Q" /> is a heat flow rate</li>
  <li><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline h" alt="h" /> is a characteristic heat transfer coefficient</li>
  <li><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline A" alt="A" /> is the perpendicular area through which heat is passing</li>
  <li>and <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline \Delta T" alt="\Delta T" /> is the temperature difference across the boundary through which heat is being transmitted, in this case outdoor and indoor temperature</li>
</ul>

<p>If we were to assume that the behavior in the apartment was constant - the same lights were always on, the same devices were always charging, the refrigerator compressor was always running - if we assumed that the thermostat was always set at 70 degrees, and we assumed that the only part of the weather that ever changed was the temperature (humidity and wind were constant) the linear regression model we ran earlier would exactly mirror this equation.  The variation in the electricity consumption would be entirely explained by the change in outdoor temperature, and the slope of the line would be the overall heat transfer coefficient of the apartment (through walls, windows, doors, floors, ceilings, leakage, etc.) multiplied by the square area of the apartment boundary.  By installing higher R-value insulation in the walls or replacing our old drafty windows with triple-glazing, Argon-filled windows, we’d be altering the overall heat transfer coefficient <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline h" alt="h" /> and effectively reducing the slope of the line we fit to the data.  We can also alter the line’s slope by changing the thermostat setting; remember, the temperature difference <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\inline \Delta T" alt="\Delta T" /> we’re talking about is the difference between the outdoor and indoor temperatures.</p>

<p>As in all things, there is no true black (statistics) and white (engineering) - there are only grays.  In this regard smart meters can  obviously help us learn about buildings in addition to occupancy/behavior.  With clever algorithms (not the simple linear model I’ve used above) we can start to disaggregate energy consumption into its constituent parts - building response to weather and occupancy behavior.  Indeed, we’ve begun to do this.  For example, BGE recommends different energy efficiency actions I can take based on my consumption patterns.  But this is just a first step in how these data can be used, even just at individual residence level.  I’m imagining exploring in future analyses how to use these data to size battery storage and solar photovoltaics.</p>

<p>In an  <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/My-BGE-Smart-Meter-Data">earlier post</a>, I showed initial descriptive plots for my electricity use.  Now that we have some more data, we can break these up to see differences as the spring season progresses.</p>

<figure class="half">
  <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/ElecHist - Feb2014.png"><img src="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/ElecHist - Feb2014.png" /></a>

  <figcaption>Histograms for February and March 2014 electricity consumption.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another way of showing the difference in each month’s energy consumption patterns would be the cumulative distribution.</p>

<figure>

  <figcaption>Histogram for February 2014 electricity consumption.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The plot above shows that for a given hourly kilowatt-hour amount, the proportion of hours at which the consumption was that amount or less is substantially higher in March than in April; of course, we’d expect that with the warmer weather.  For example, about 18% of the time in February the hourly consumption was 1 kilowatt-hour or less, while in March it was the case about 70% of the time.</p>

<p>For analysis tools, I’m mainly using Python (in the form of iPython notebooks) with the <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> module for data analysis (the sklearn module for machine learning later). Suffice it to say it’s rad.  I also use <a href="https://github.com/jtelszasz">Github</a>, both for my analysis and modeling as well as this blog itself (as you can tell from the current web address), so you’re welcome to peruse or use any of my code from there.  I’ll try to keep my iPython notebooks pretty clean and explained well as a supplement to the blog.  You can find the notebook for the analysis below <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jtelszasz/my_energy/blob/master/My_Energy.ipynb?create=1">here</a>.  (Just click the link - you don’t need anything special to be able to view the notebook.)</p>

<p>Pandas has been great for data analysis and makes things intuitive and quick.  As a mechanical engineer, a lot of my previous work was in Matlab.  It of course has its strengths but for data analysis it always took quite a bit of manual data munging, especially when it came to time series. </p>

<p>Anyways, using the Python groupby function I can manipulate the time series of my hourly electricity consumption from my BGE smart data.  The data starts from January 18 and I now have a few full months of data.  Below is a quick code snipet of how I’m using groupby in this case.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="python"><span class="c"># elec_and_weather: hourly electricity usage</span>
<span class="n">elec_and_weather</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">groupby</span><span class="p">([(</span><span class="n">elec_and_weather</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dayofweek</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">elec_and_weather</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dayofweek</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="n">elec_and_weather</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hour</span><span class="p">])</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="the-correct-answer-is">The correct answer is…</h3>

<p>To arrive at the plot below, I actually first sliced the data by month and then applied the groupby shown above.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/AvgDays_Elec_Feb_March.png"><img src="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/AvgDays_Elec_Feb_March.png" /></a>
  <figcaption>Average weekday and weekend electricity consumption for February and March of 2014.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is the “guess what time Justin wakes up for work” plot. The coffee pot consumes 900 W, and we typically have it on for about 20 minutes or so, which would amount to a spike of .3 kWh for that hour. The roommate’s hair dryer consumes 1,875 W and she uses it for about 5 minutes (so she claims, I think I want to see data for that), so that would make for about a .15 kWh spike. Of course that’s what I think a typical day looks like. Not every weekday looked like that (if I worked from home, I probably used the french press instead of the coffee maker, and sometimes the roommate showers the night before and so doesn’t blow dry the hair in the morn). Therefore, the 6am peak in the weekday averages is not quite that high. </p>

<p>Since this spike should be strictly due to behavior, we don’t need to look at the difference between February and March.  We can look at the 5am-6am difference over all the weekday samples thusly:</p>

<figure>
  <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/Wkday_5am6amDiff - Feb_March.png"><img src="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/Wkday_5am6amDiff - Feb_March.png" /></a>
  <figcaption>5am to 6am difference across all weekday samples.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The average weekday difference over this time period between 5am and 6am is .253 kWh.  The 20 minute coffee maker run and the 5 minute blow dryer would amount to .45 kWh.  Looks like that was the case at least a couple of times.</p>

<p>This is a good illustration of privacy concerns around ubiquitous data capture.  Measuring energy consumption is a proxy for measuring human behavior, and while I don’t share a lot of the privacy concerns that many out there do, I can understand why this is problematic.  Suffice it to say, I don’t care that a reader of this blog (are there any?) knows when I wake up (among other things).  Moreover, at larger scales than individual households - say at city block levels - these concerns should start to fade away, as aggregated data can effectively anonymize the information.  </p>
