Here's a small idea that I think would make the upcoming election cycle incrementally more bearable.  

Politicians seemingly pick numbers, figures, statistics, and trends out of thin air.  This can be infuriating no matter where you fall on the political spectrum.  Why don't we push politicians to post annotated transcripts of their speeches and debates that provide citations?  Surely they have an intern or two that they can promote from sticking signs on front lawns to transcribing and footnoting.  This would be a big step in the direction of transparency and a substantive way to keep politicians honest.

**I'd propose we call it the <a href='https://twitter.com/search?q=%23showyourwork&src=typd'>#ShowYourWork</a> campaign.**  If elementary school kids can show their work on math problems and high schoolers can cite their references in English papers, surely our politicians can follow their lead.  Moreover, it would signal a commitment to and appreciation for the STEM fields that politicians like to pay lip service to when it comes to job growth.
