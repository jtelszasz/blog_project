I posted this plot last in my <a href="{{ site.url }}/articles/Guess-What-Time-Justin-Wakes-Up">last post</a>, but I'll show it again here.  This is the average weekday and average weekend day for Janurary 18 to February 28.

Obviously there's both qualitative and quantitative differences.  Weekdays during that period were fairly regular in terms of occupancy and behavior (up at the same time each morning, home at similar times, similar end uses), but what about weather?

Weekend days were on average more than 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer during the period of January 18 to February 28.  (There were 6 weekends between and including January 18.)
