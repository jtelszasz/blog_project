<p>The city <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-ci-freddie-gray-officers-20150421-story.html">released the names of the six officers involved in Freddie Gray’s arrest and subsequent death</a>.</p>

<p>Below is how much each of them earned in fiscal year 2014 based on <a href="http://data.baltimorecity.gov">Open Baltimore</a> data.</p>

<p>The six officers have been suspended <strong>with pay</strong>.  Assuming a 40 hour work week and 48 working weeks in the year, below are these officers’ hourly wages, daily wages, and assuming a 50% ratio of salary for benefits and insurance (typical assumption for wage calculations), the six officers are costing Baltimore City taxpayers $2,151.44 every day of their suspension.  Today is April 26 and as far as I can tell from <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/21/freddie-gray-death-baltimore-officers-suspended_n_7105368.html">the earliest Associated Press announcement</a> of their suspension, the officers have been suspended for six days, so the <strong>current bill to taxpayers is $12,908.63 and counting</strong>.</p>
