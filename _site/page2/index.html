    <p>I took a quick look at the Vital Signs dataset from the<a href="http://www.bniajfi.org/indicators"> Baltimore Neighborhoods Indicators Alliance - Jacob France Institute (BNIA)</a> at the University of Baltimore (data also available at <a href="http://data.baltimorecity.gov/">Open Baltimore</a>) and created some <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/">Hans Rosling-style plots</a>.</p>

<p>These are clean datasets of socio-economic indicators derived from the U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey and Baltimore agencies, among other sources.  The BNIA has built a <a href="http://bniajfi.org/vital_signs/">website for mapping data</a> and they were rightly lauded for cleaning and opening up this data for public use, but I’ve seen only a handful of analyses based on the Vital Signs datasets.</p>

<p>In this first plot, the bubbles are sized according to the total number of children between the ages of 5 and 18 (school age) living in each neighborhood.</p>

<p>Definitely check out BNIA’s website, and <a href="http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/413219-NNIP-an-Open-Data-in-Baltimore.pdf">this</a> is a good synopsis of open data in Baltimore.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I was able to get in contact with Edward Ericson Jr. over at Baltimore’s City Paper concerning the <a href="http://www.citypaper.com/news/mobtownbeat/bcp-victims-of-a-unique-baltimore-parking-problem-fight-the-law-and-the-law-wins-20141216,0,5288351.story">parking investigation at 4200 Wickford Rd</a>.  Ed was kind enough to bounce my findings in a <a href="http://www.citypaper.com/blogs/the-news-hole/bcp-wandering-eye-a-neonoir-crime-blotter-date-on-parking-in-baltimore-and-more-20150305,0,1269875.story">quick update blurb</a>.  Full text is below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Parking being what it is in Baltimore, it’s not surprising that a light-hearted look at the lengths city councilmembers are required to go on behalf of constituents who are inconvenienced by tickets—which City Paper published in December—would be met by data hounds. Now comes Justin Elszasz, who analyzed the city’s parking ticket database to conclude that—surprise—the issue is not so big, in the grand scheme of things. “What is curious is that the open data for parking citations at the 4200 block of Wickford Rd. are not showing a rampant citation issue as the article or residents suggest,” the blog post says, above a bar graph depicting more than 20 citations in April of 2014 and 15 in November-December. But the data looks like exactly the sort of thing the residents complained (and CP wrote) about—sporatic, complaint-driven hard-assery. We were careful not to quantify the damage because we did not have the tools or time to do the analysis Elszasz did. And he confirms what City Paper reported, right down to our tone. We said the residents—who actually have garages on their back alley—are inconvenienced by the law prohibiting them from parking on the curb, facing the wrong way. Elszasz says: “It truly pales in comparison to some of the blocks I’ve been looking at recently. The article claims that parking tickets have appeared in the middle of the night, ‘depicting the parking enforcement agents as thieves in the night.’ It looks like that actually was the case a couple few times - around 4:30am on April 4 and 8, 2014, and around 2:30am on April 18, 2014. But overall, this article and the residents on this block appear to be making something out of nothing. The grand total of fines issued for the 41 citations above is $1,312.” - Edward Ericson Jr.</p>

    <p>The Baltimore citation open data also includes a field for open balance, meaning the amount still owed to the city for each citation.</p>

<p>With this information we can look at the rates of unpaid citations by citation type.  Below I’ve calculated these ratios for all description types, but have only included for comparison those categories that had more than 100 citations in the database (so we hopefully have meaningful comparisons).</p>

<!--The red light violations, however, should be of particular concern since they pose a safety risk.  While many of us in Baltimore have independently come to the same conclusion that the red lights are poorly timed, this does not excuse ignoring them.  The fact that red light violations have a higher portion of unpaid citations seems to indicate that the perhaps a stiffer penalty increase is warranted in order to curb this behavior.-->

<h2 id="another-suggestion-for-baltimore-dot-and-mayors-office-of-it">Another suggestion for Baltimore DOT and Mayor’s Office of IT</h2>

<p>The dataset that gets posted on <a href="http://data.baltimorecity.gov">the Open Baltimore data portal</a> could really use better documenatation.  Here’s another example of why.  Since the speed camera program was halted in Baltimore, certain citations are no longer captured by this dataset, since parking enforcers don’t issue any kind of moving violations.  Some of those types are still in this dataset, however - a hold over from when the camera program was still in effect.  They should be removed before any analysis or comparisons.  </p>

    <p>Here’s a suggestion directed at the Department of Transportation for improving their citation system.  </p>

<p>I’ve alluded to this in previous posts, but this should make it clear as day.  Looking at all citations since February of 2013, the category “All Other Parking Meter Violations” trumps all of the other citation types by a wide margin.  My guess is that, given its prominence, these are citations for time expiring on a parking meter.  But why code it as “all other?”  An “other” option should be a last resort, when all other codes don’t apply.  If parking enforcers are having to use this code so extensively, it suggests that they need more nuanced options for coding parking infringements.  This is essentially information about parking in the city that’s up for grabs and we’re leaving it on the table.</p>

    <p>In a recent post I’ve shown particular blocks that became targets for parking enforcement.  The short five block stretch on North Charles Street right around the corner from my apartment is one of those target locations.</p>

<p>So when is that stretch being targeted?  Here are the hourly total citation counts for those five blocks on North Charles St.  Looks like you’re safe before 10am on the weekends, and maybe have a shot if you need a quick spot around 3pm.</p>

<h2 id="dot--baltimore-it-should-provide-new-citation-description-options">DOT &amp; Baltimore IT Should Provide New Citation Description Options</h2>

<p>Of course as we’ve seen in the past, parking police are using the “All Other Parking Meter Violations” predominantly, which masks the true cause of the citation.  In this instance, these are metered parking spots so my guess is their time has expired.  This is something that DOT and Baltimore Mayor’s Office of IT could easily provide a new description code for so we know that this is the cause.  </p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Baltimore’s City Paper recently <a href="http://www.citypaper.com/news/mobtownbeat/bcp-victims-of-a-unique-baltimore-parking-problem-fight-the-law-and-the-law-wins-20141216,0,5288351.story">took a look at a unique parking situation</a> in Baltimore at the 4200 block of Wickford Road.  Unfortunately, they didn’t take a peek at the same open data for parking citations I’ve been investigating lately.</p>

<p>This road is a small two-way street in a quiet, wealthy neighborhood adjacent to the Johns Hopkins University campus called Keswick.  The street is narrow, and so vehicles typically park on either side with their tires past the curb which is illegal.  Apparently they also occasionally park on the left facing the wrong direction.  </p>

<p>Start here in Google Street View and work your way north - the street is indeed quite narrow and most cars (save for maybe the Smart car) are parked with their two right tires over the curb.  The Smart car and several others are parked on the left side facing the wrong direction.</p>

</center>

<p>What is curious is that the <a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Transportation/Parking-Citations/n4ma-fj3m">open data for parking citations</a> at the 4200 block of Wickford Rd. are not showing a rampant citation issue as the article or residents suggest.</p>

<p>In fact, here is the full list of citations at the 4200 block of Wickford Rd. from the parking citation data.</p>

<p>It truly pales in comparison to some of the <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Rapid-Increase-In-Citations/">blocks I’ve been looking at recently</a>.  The article claims that parking tickets have appeared in the middle of the night, “depicting the parking enforcement agents as thieves in the night.”  It looks like that actually was the case a couple few times - around 4:30am on April 4 and 10, 2014, and around 2:30am on April 18, 2014.  But overall, this article and the residents on this block appear to be making something out of nothing.  The grand total of fines issued for the 41 citations above is $1,312.</p>

    <p>Unless this dataset is somehow <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Quick-Response-From-Baltimore-Chief-Data-Officer/">still screwed up</a>, there was a stark shift in behavior that coincided with the explosion of parking citations issued in Baltimore.  </p>

<center>
<figure>
  <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/2015-02/Daily_Citations_Unpaid.png"><img src="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/2015-02/Daily_Citations_Unpaid.png" /></a>
</figure>
</center>

<p>The plot above shows the perentage of tickets (daily) that remain unpaid over time.  The trend in 2014 makes sense: practically 100% of the tickets issued yesterday would be unpaid.  One would expect that the further back in time one looks, less tickets would have an outstanding balance.  This is certainly the case looking back as far as January 2014, and I’ve added a dashed line to continue the expected trend further backwards in time.</p>

<p>But what actually happens looking back further than January 2014 is quite different.  According to these data, the proportion of unpaid tickets increases almost to almost 70% when looking back the full two years.  70% of tickets from 2 years ago unpaid, while 10% from a year ago unpaid?  This seems fishy.  I can imagine four possibilities as to why we see this in the data.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Dataset is still screwed up.</strong> Occam’s razor.  Q.E.D.  I asked Baltimore Chief Data Officer to check it out and will follow up soon.</li>
  <li><strong>Increase in penalties that incentivized prompt payment.</strong>  <a href="http://archive.baltimorecity.gov/portals/0/charter%20and%20Codes/code/Art%2031%20-%20Transit&amp;Traff.pdf"> Article 31 Subtitle 36 of the Baltimore City Code</a> establishes the fines for parking violations, and §36-22   in particular sets forth the penalties that accrue when deliquent.  Right now the penalties are set at the lesser of $16 per month delinquent or ten times the amount of the original fine.  It looks like the last time this section was modified was through Ordinance 10-302, but as far as I can tell this actually added the 10X cap on penalties so this can’t be it. </li>
  <li><strong>Parking ticket amnesty.</strong> <a href="http://archive.baltimorecity.gov/portals/0/charter%20and%20Codes/code/Art%2031%20-%20Transit&amp;Traff.pdf"> Article 31 Subtitle 36 of the Baltimore City Code</a> (§36-22 specifically) allows for the periodic offering of amnesty from penalties resulting from unpaid tickets.  The amnesty periods last 2 days.  This authority was established in 2003 at which time the first amnesty was offered.  The provisions also establish a ten-year moratorium on amnesties from the time of the first one, so the next one that could have been offered was 2013.  A parking ticket amnesty would certainly reduce the proportion of citations with an outstanding balance and could help explain the trend we see in 2013.  But another amnesty has not yet been offered as of February 2015, so this can’t explain the change in proportion of unpaid tickets we’re seeing.  Moreover, the trend we see in 2013 is across the entire year rather than a dramatic drop over a 2-day period that would result from such an amnesty period.</li>
  <li><strong>Change in sampling (behavior of those sampled).</strong>  Having eliminated options 2 and 3 and assuming the data are clean and reliable, the last option I came up with is that the rapid increase of parking citations in certain locations drastically biased the sample.  It would appear that the strategy of targeting specific locations as I’ve shown in <a href="">previous posts</a> has paid off, since the total fines issued has shot up while the proportion of tickets remaining unpaid has significantly dropped.  This is an indication of a much more effective parking policing policy (revenue generation) by the city, although it likely causes a lot of frustration for those living and parking in the targeted locations.</li>

<p>One can imagine that this explosion resulted from particular areas being targeted, rather than every block in Baltimore experiencing a proportional increase in citations issued.  Below are the top 25 blocks in terms of the difference between parking citations issued in the month of September 2013 and March 2014.</p>

<p>I’ve removed the “U/B” locations from the map below because it isn’t clear exactly which block those were issued on.  I tried reaching out to the Baltimore data people about it but haven’t had luck yet.  I believe they’re University of Baltimore locations, so suffice it to say that University of Baltimore has also become a target for parking enforcement.</p>

<p>The locations are wholly predictable.  The stretch of North Charles Street through Mt. Vernon, Light Street in Federal Hill, Harbor East, Fells Point, and some spots near hospitals.  </p>

<h2 id="roland-ave">5100 Roland Ave.</h2>

<p>The only one that appears somewhat random is the 5100 block of Roland Avenue.  Citations clearly exploded here…</p>

<p>“All other parking meter violations” really doesn’t help sort out what the cause is, but looking at the Google Map street view one can see a 2 hour parking sign.  The curb also looks like it’s non-existent, so I’m wondering if people put their tires into the grass and then get cited.</p>

</center>

<h2 id="lot-jfa">“400 LOT JFA”</h2>

<p>I’ve also manually located the “400 LOT JFA” location on the map - I believe this is a parking lot under the Jones Falls Expressway, and the only one near a 400 block address is the one I’ve located.  Looking at the data, the police didn’t even start ticketing at this location until February 2014.  Again, “All other parking meter violations” is the dominant mode of citation, so I really don’t have a clue what might be going on.</p>

<p>Since the <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/sun-investigates/bs-md-speed-camera-hearing-20141201-story.html">traffic camera program ended in Baltimore in 2013</a> it appears enforcement policies have taken a dramatic turn to make up some of the lost revenue.  Moreover, judging by the spike this past December, I’d hazard a guess that either year-end budgets were looking tight or that goals or quotas had been set at the beginning of the year and were not being met.</p>

<h2 id="what-locations-are-they-targeting">What locations are they targeting?</h2>

<h3 id="university-of-baltimore">University of Baltimore</h3>

<p>I would post a map, but I haven’t been able to confirm that “U/B” is University of Baltimore, especially since some of the street names aren’t near the university.  University students are prime candidates for parking tickets though, so it does make sense that so many citations are issued there.</p>

<h3 id="block-of-n-charles-st">1200 Block of N. Charles St.</h3>

<p>The 1200 block of N. Charles St. just happens to be the block I live on.  As soon as I discovered that, I had an inkling as to the reason why this would be the case and the data back this up.  This road turns into a major thoroughfare for commuters driving north out of downtown to head back to the ‘burbs, and as far as Charles St. goes this block is probably the block on which cars are most likely to be stopped and blocking traffic due to the number of businesses and close proximity of University of Baltimore.</p>

<p>There’s a Starbucks on one corner with a Chipotle next to it, immediately in front of which there is a bus stop.  In addition to the Starbucks and Chipotle, there are a number of other businesses (frozen yogurt, licquor store, other restaurants) that presumably all take deliveries at regular intervals.  On numerous occasions I’ve walked past and a large truck or semi is parked at the bus stop with a ticket on its windshield.  This would explain at least the “In Transit Zone/Stop,” but I do wonder at how consistent parking police are in their coding of citations.</p>

<p>Street parking immediately behind the bus stop shown below is prohibited weekdays between 4pm and 6pm, which the data show is another large revenue generator.   </p>

<p>It’s interesting that such a large number of fines are coded as “No Stopping/Parking Stadium Event Cambden”  since Cambden Yards isn’t nearby or even on Charles St.  Again, makes me wonder at how the parking police are trained to code the infractions.</p>
