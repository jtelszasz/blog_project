    <p>Here’s a suggestion directed at the Department of Transportation for improving their citation system.  </p>

<p>I’ve alluded to this in previous posts, but this should make it clear as day.  Looking at all citations since February of 2013, the category “All Other Parking Meter Violations” trumps all of the other citation types by a wide margin.  My guess is that, given its prominence, these are citations for time expiring on a parking meter.  But why code it as “all other?”  An “other” option should be a last resort, when all other codes don’t apply.  If parking enforcers are having to use this code so extensively, it suggests that they need more nuanced options for coding parking infringements.  This is essentially information about parking in the city that’s up for grabs and we’re leaving it on the table.</p>

    <p>In a recent post I’ve shown particular blocks that became targets for parking enforcement.  The short five block stretch on North Charles Street right around the corner from my apartment is one of those target locations.</p>

<p>So when is that stretch being targeted?  Here are the hourly total citation counts for those five blocks on North Charles St.  Looks like you’re safe before 10am on the weekends, and maybe have a shot if you need a quick spot around 3pm.</p>

<h2 id="dot--baltimore-it-should-provide-new-citation-description-options">DOT &amp; Baltimore IT Should Provide New Citation Description Options</h2>

<p>Of course as we’ve seen in the past, parking police are using the “All Other Parking Meter Violations” predominantly, which masks the true cause of the citation.  In this instance, these are metered parking spots so my guess is their time has expired.  This is something that DOT and Baltimore Mayor’s Office of IT could easily provide a new description code for so we know that this is the cause.  </p>

    <p>Baltimore’s City Paper recently <a href="http://www.citypaper.com/news/mobtownbeat/bcp-victims-of-a-unique-baltimore-parking-problem-fight-the-law-and-the-law-wins-20141216,0,5288351.story">took a look at a unique parking situation</a> in Baltimore at the 4200 block of Wickford Road.  Unfortunately, they didn’t take a peek at the same open data for parking citations I’ve been investigating lately.</p>

<p>This road is a small two-way street in a quiet, wealthy neighborhood adjacent to the Johns Hopkins University campus called Keswick.  The street is narrow, and so vehicles typically park on either side with their tires past the curb which is illegal.  Apparently they also occasionally park on the left facing the wrong direction.  </p>

<p>Start here in Google Street View and work your way north - the street is indeed quite narrow and most cars (save for maybe the Smart car) are parked with their two right tires over the curb.  The Smart car and several others are parked on the left side facing the wrong direction.</p>

</center>

<p>What is curious is that the <a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Transportation/Parking-Citations/n4ma-fj3m">open data for parking citations</a> at the 4200 block of Wickford Rd. are not showing a rampant citation issue as the article or residents suggest.</p>

</figure>
</center>

<p>In fact, here is the full list of citations at the 4200 block of Wickford Rd. from the parking citation data.</p>

</figure>
</center>

<p>It truly pales in comparison to some of the <a href="http://localhost:4000/articles/Rapid-Increase-In-Citations/">blocks I’ve been looking at recently</a>.  The article claims that parking tickets have appeared in the middle of the night, “depicting the parking enforcement agents as thieves in the night.”  It looks like that actually was the case a couple few times - around 4:30am on April 4 and 10, 2014, and around 2:30am on April 18, 2014.  But overall, this article and the residents on this block appear to be making something out of nothing.  The grand total of fines issued for the 41 citations above is $1,312.</p>

    <p>Unless this dataset is somehow <a href="http://localhost:4000/articles/Quick-Response-From-Baltimore-Chief-Data-Officer/">still screwed up</a>, there was a stark shift in behavior that coincided with the explosion of parking citations issued in Baltimore.  </p>

<center>
<figure>
  <a href="http://localhost:4000/images/2015-02/Daily_Citations_Unpaid.png"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/2015-02/Daily_Citations_Unpaid.png" /></a>
</figure>
</center>

<p>The plot above shows the perentage of tickets (daily) that remain unpaid over time.  The trend in 2014 makes sense: practically 100% of the tickets issued yesterday would be unpaid.  One would expect that the further back in time one looks, less tickets would have an outstanding balance.  This is certainly the case looking back as far as January 2014, and I’ve added a dashed line to continue the expected trend further backwards in time.</p>

<p>But what actually happens looking back further than January 2014 is quite different.  According to these data, the proportion of unpaid tickets increases almost to almost 70% when looking back the full two years.  70% of tickets from 2 years ago unpaid, while 10% from a year ago unpaid?  This seems fishy.  I can imagine four possibilities as to why we see this in the data.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Dataset is still screwed up.</strong> Occam’s razor.  Q.E.D.  I asked Baltimore Chief Data Officer to check it out and will follow up soon.</li>
  <li><strong>Increase in penalties that incentivized prompt payment.</strong>  <a href="http://archive.baltimorecity.gov/portals/0/charter%20and%20Codes/code/Art%2031%20-%20Transit&amp;Traff.pdf"> Article 31 Subtitle 36 of the Baltimore City Code</a> establishes the fines for parking violations, and §36-22   in particular sets forth the penalties that accrue when deliquent.  Right now the penalties are set at the lesser of $16 per month delinquent or ten times the amount of the original fine.  It looks like the last time this section was modified was through Ordinance 10-302, but as far as I can tell this actually added the 10X cap on penalties so this can’t be it. </li>
  <li><strong>Parking ticket amnesty.</strong> <a href="http://archive.baltimorecity.gov/portals/0/charter%20and%20Codes/code/Art%2031%20-%20Transit&amp;Traff.pdf"> Article 31 Subtitle 36 of the Baltimore City Code</a> (§36-22 specifically) allows for the periodic offering of amnesty from penalties resulting from unpaid tickets.  The amnesty periods last 2 days.  This authority was established in 2003 at which time the first amnesty was offered.  The provisions also establish a ten-year moratorium on amnesties from the time of the first one, so the next one that could have been offered was 2013.  A parking ticket amnesty would certainly reduce the proportion of citations with an outstanding balance and could help explain the trend we see in 2013.  But another amnesty has not yet been offered as of February 2015, so this can’t explain the change in proportion of unpaid tickets we’re seeing.  Moreover, the trend we see in 2013 is across the entire year rather than a dramatic drop over a 2-day period that would result from such an amnesty period.</li>
  <li><strong>Change in sampling (behavior of those sampled).</strong>  Having eliminated options 2 and 3 and assuming the data are clean and reliable, the last option I came up with is that the rapid increase of parking citations in certain locations drastically biased the sample.  It would appear that the strategy of targeting specific locations as I’ve shown in <a href="">previous posts</a> has paid off, since the total fines issued has shot up while the proportion of tickets remaining unpaid has significantly dropped.  This is an indication of a much more effective parking policing policy (revenue generation) by the city, although it likely causes a lot of frustration for those living and parking in the targeted locations.</li>

<p>I’ve removed the “U/B” locations from the map below because it isn’t clear exactly which block those were issued on.  I tried reaching out to the Baltimore data people about it but haven’t had luck yet.  I believe they’re University of Baltimore locations, so suffice it to say that University of Baltimore has also become a target for parking enforcement.</p>

<p>The locations are wholly predictable.  The stretch of North Charles Street through Mt. Vernon, Light Street in Federal Hill, Harbor East, Fells Point, and some spots near hospitals.  </p>

<h2 id="roland-ave">5100 Roland Ave.</h2>

<p>The only one that appears somewhat random is the 5100 block of Roland Avenue.  Citations clearly exploded here…</p>

<p>“All other parking meter violations” really doesn’t help sort out what the cause is, but looking at the Google Map street view one can see a 2 hour parking sign.  The curb also looks like it’s non-existent, so I’m wondering if people put their tires into the grass and then get cited.</p>

<h2 id="lot-jfa">“400 LOT JFA”</h2>

<p>I’ve also manually located the “400 LOT JFA” location on the map - I believe this is a parking lot under the Jones Falls Expressway, and the only one near a 400 block address is the one I’ve located.  Looking at the data, the police didn’t even start ticketing at this location until February 2014.  Again, “All other parking meter violations” is the dominant mode of citation, so I really don’t have a clue what might be going on.</p>

<p>Since the <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/sun-investigates/bs-md-speed-camera-hearing-20141201-story.html">traffic camera program ended in Baltimore in 2013</a> it appears enforcement policies have taken a dramatic turn to make up some of the lost revenue.  Moreover, judging by the spike this past December, I’d hazard a guess that either year-end budgets were looking tight or that goals or quotas had been set at the beginning of the year and were not being met.</p>

<h2 id="what-locations-are-they-targeting">What locations are they targeting?</h2>

<p>Between January 20, 2013 and January 20, 2015, citations were issued at 38,597 unique locations.  <strong>1.2% of those locations account for 45.8% of the total value of fines issued.</strong>  What were the target locations?  Here are the top 20 locations in terms of total fines issued.</p>

<h3 id="university-of-baltimore">University of Baltimore</h3>

<p>I would post a map, but I haven’t been able to confirm that “U/B” is University of Baltimore, especially since some of the street names aren’t near the university.  University students are prime candidates for parking tickets though, so it does make sense that so many citations are issued there.</p>

<h3 id="block-of-n-charles-st">1200 Block of N. Charles St.</h3>

<p>The 1200 block of N. Charles St. just happens to be the block I live on.  As soon as I discovered that, I had an inkling as to the reason why this would be the case and the data back this up.  This road turns into a major thoroughfare for commuters driving north out of downtown to head back to the ‘burbs, and as far as Charles St. goes this block is probably the block on which cars are most likely to be stopped and blocking traffic due to the number of businesses and close proximity of University of Baltimore.</p>

<p>There’s a Starbucks on one corner with a Chipotle next to it, immediately in front of which there is a bus stop.  In addition to the Starbucks and Chipotle, there are a number of other businesses (frozen yogurt, licquor store, other restaurants) that presumably all take deliveries at regular intervals.  On numerous occasions I’ve walked past and a large truck or semi is parked at the bus stop with a ticket on its windshield.  This would explain at least the “In Transit Zone/Stop,” but I do wonder at how consistent parking police are in their coding of citations.</p>

<p>Street parking immediately behind the bus stop shown below is prohibited weekdays between 4pm and 6pm, which the data show is another large revenue generator.   </p>

<p>It’s interesting that such a large number of fines are coded as “No Stopping/Parking Stadium Event Cambden”  since Cambden Yards isn’t nearby or even on Charles St.  Again, makes me wonder at how the parking police are trained to code the infractions.</p>

    <p>Within hours of publishing my last post on <a href="http://localhost:4000/articles/Baltimores-Lost-Traffic-Camera-Revenue/">Baltimore’s parking (etc.) citation dataset</a>, the issues were corrected thanks to Sharon Paley at <a href="http://www.hackbaltimore.org">Hack Baltimore</a> and Heather Hudson, Baltimore’s Chief Data Officer in the <a href="http://moit.baltimorecity.gov/Home.aspx">Mayor’s Office of Information Technology</a>.</p>

<p>Sharon was kind enough to forward my work on to Heather, who removed old and extraneous data and added some description to some of the citation data fields.  With Heather’s permission I’ve excerpted her email below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The dataset should, and now does, reflect 2 rolling years of citations and any older citations that still have an outstanding balance. The data was not being updated and purged consistently, resulting in older citations still appearing. These older citation records were likely not updated properly (balance, penalty, etc), so have now been purged from the dataset.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reason for the 2 year  limited time frame of the dataset is that the Parking Citations system is housed on a mainframe, which has storage limitations. We are also forced to re-use citation numbers, which necessitates purging of older citation records.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks to your article, I have added a more informative description of the dataset, as well as short descriptions of the currency columns you mentioned. I hope that this helps users better understand the data presented.</p>

<p>I exported another csv file the evening of January 21 that resulted in 1,004,288 rows (compared to about 2.7 million rows previously, meaning <strong>63% of the dataset was erroneous and discarded</strong>).  Total fines issued in the whole datset now amount to just over $48 million.  </p>

<h2 id="why-are-there-still-data-in-here-from-before-january-21-2013-2-years-before-the-date-i-downloaded-this-set">Why are there still data in here from before January 21, 2013 (2 years before the date I downloaded this set)?</h2>

<p>Well, you wouldn’t want to remove information about citations that haven’t been paid in full yet.  484,146 records (out of just over 1 million, or about half) are from before 2 years ago because they haven’t been paid in full.  I confirmed that there are zero records for which the import date is more than two years old and does not have an outstanding balance (if going by the violation date, there are 16 records as of Jan. 21, 2015 older than two years with a zero balance in the database).  </p>

<p>What this means is that we effectively have two datasets here: one for accounts with open balances from before the rolling 2 year date and one for all citations (regardless of balance) for the last 2 years rolling.  Lumping them all together wouldn’t yield apples-to-apples comparisons or indicate policy changes properly since we’re missing citation records that have been paid and were issued/imported more than two years ago.  We can however do this with the data for the most recent 2 years.  I suppose the pre-2-years ago data could be considered the “delinquent” batch and data for the most recent 2 years could be called the “full 2 year” batch.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-money-is-owed-to-the-city">How much money is owed to the city?</h2>

<p>This is the kicker.  Looking only at the old citations prior to January 21, 2013?  The outstanding balance is <strong>$102,384,876.00</strong>, and that’s on citations that would have originally been worth only $23,873,386.00.  In other words, for still-open tickets prior to January 21, 2013, the city is owed more than <strong>4 times the value</strong> of the initial citations.  Wonder if the city has a plan of attack for reeling some of this in?  The wages of parking police probably pale in comparsion to the value of these citations, so maybe they see this as free money that they’ll never make the effort to get, having already paid the overhead. Of course there are logistical and legal challenges to enforcing these as well, but this is surely money the city of Baltimore could use.</p>

<p>Thanks again to Sharon at Hack Baltimore and Heather, our city’s Chief Data Officer, for helping to keep our government’s open data clean, current and useful.</p>

    <p>The title of the dataset I’m working with on Baltimore’s <a href="http://data.baltimorecity.gov/">open data portal</a> is “Parking Citations.”  I downloaded a snapshot of the dataset which ended up being 2,689,647 total citations through January 12, 2015. </p>

<center>
<div><iframe width="500px" title="Parking Citations" height="425px" src="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/w/n4ma-fj3m/ta62-x9wp?cur=i5SwBTR0Hvd&amp;from=root" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Transportation/Parking-Citations/n4ma-fj3m" title="Parking Citations" target="_blank">Parking Citations</a></iframe><p><a href="http://www.socrata.com/" target="_blank">Powered by Socrata</a></p></div>

<p>But parking is not the only thing captured in this set. Traffic camera violations are also here (“Fixed Speed Cameras,” “Mobile Speed Cameras,” and probably some “Red Light Violations” and “Right on Red” citations) which were far and away the city’s largest revenue generator out of all of the infraction types captured here.  The fixed speed cameras alone issued nearly $28 million in citations over a three year period, until the <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/sun-investigates/bs-md-speed-camera-hearing-20141201-story.html">program was ended</a>.  The last two rows appear to be one-off citations.  It’s also curious that the last record of a “Snow Emergency Route Violation” was in August. In Baltimore.</p>

<p>This all isn’t quite syncing up with what the <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/sun-investigates/bs-md-speed-camera-hearing-20141201-story.html">Baltimore Sun reported</a> about the traffic camera program.  According to this article, the traffic camera program generated about $140 million over 10 years.  The data contained in Baltimore’s open data portal must be incomplete, since I’m seeing a total of about $127 million for all violation types, not just cameras.  </p>

<p>To show this a bit more dramatically, here’s the time series of total monthly citations issued for the top 10 revenue generator categories.  It’s pretty clear that the data are incomplete since the traffic camera categories should have dominated for 10 years straight, and we’re seeing no significant records before 2007, even though the earliest start dates shown in the table above show dates typically starting in 2002-2003, with “Red Light Violations” starting in 1999.  Unfortunately, the Baltimore open data portal does not provide a data dictionary or substantive description of what all is contained in the dataset and what each field represents.  For example, in addition to “violFine,” there are “balance,” “openFine,” and “openPenalty” fields which all include “$” signs in the records to indicate currency.  These aren’t defined anywhere.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t say that the lack of definitions and descriptions of the data render them completely useless, but it does make it more difficult to make apples-to-apples comparisons and draw conclusions.</p>

    <p>I find myself importing a slew of comma-separated value (csv) files quite often so I wrote up a quick bit of code to handle it.  </p>

<p>It’s uber-simple - just loops through all the csv’s in a directory, appends them to one Pandas dataframe, and saves the new csv.  It also tacks on the filenames of each file if separating into the original files is needed later.  This also assumes all the fields are named exactly the same in all the csv files.  Sure beats reading each individually and merging after.</p>
