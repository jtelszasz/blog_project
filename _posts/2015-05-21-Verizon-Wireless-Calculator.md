A few weeks ago, my 2-year contract came due for a phone upgrade.  Seeing as how I was on an iPhone 4 and Apple's recent OS upgrades have sucked the life clean out of it, I was looking forward to purchasing a new phone with the hopes that the new one will last beyond the 2-year cycle.  I was going to purchase an iPhone 6, and I knew (or so I thought) what it would cost up front if I were to sign on a new 2-year contract.  Simple, straight-forward.  No sales pitches necessary.

Then I entered the Verizon Wireless store.

Within a few moments of arrival and signing in, my name was called and I was paired with a sales rep.  Whilst hovering over me, he quickly moved the conversation from the phone itself to something called the <a href='http://www.verizonwireless.com/support/verizon-edge-faqs/'>Edge plan</a>.  I hadn't bothered looking at the Edge plan before coming to the store - from the marketing material it seemed that it was targeted at customers interested in upgrading their phone more rapidly than every two years.  I do not count myself in that category, so I didn't bother looking into it.

The salesman threw so many numbers at me that my head was spinning.  He was claiming that I could get some accessory package essentially for free by switching to the Edge program.  I couldn't follow any of his logic, and I was only marginally clearer on the details when the manager attempted to explain the costs to me.  I walked out of the store frustrated and not wanting to commit there and then.

I figure I can't have been the only Verizon customer to have experienced this recently.  In order to figure out what the actual costs were and whether I'd actually save money I made a quick calculator for my family and I to use.  I'm sharing it here in case it helps others.  

It's pretty simple for now, and assumes you aren't taking the bait and trying to upgrade your phone more frequently than two years.  The white boxes are entry cells: select the phone you want, enter your typical monthly service costs, and enter the percent down payment on the phone you'd like to make if you're considering the Edge program.  The box to the right gives your estimated monthly bill (bold black text) and the total cost over two years for your options (in bold red text).
