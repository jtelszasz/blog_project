## Raison D'Etre

I live in Baltimore and commute to DC for work everyday, and am often asked how long the commute is. Although the total round trip is technically three hours, I prefer to think of it as one hour of actual commute with two hours to do as I please on the commuter train.  Although reading, podcasts and other media are entertaining filler, after a short time I decided rather to spend my time productively.  This blog is the product of my efforts during my commute to learn more about data analysis techniques.

## Me

My name is Justin, and by training I'm a mechanical engineer.  I help write energy efficiency policy for the U.S. Department of Energy but am also interested in data analytics and urban planning.  I left a PhD program, and so I use this blog as a means for exploring and researching topics I find interesting.  If you have ideas, data, questions, or problems that you'd like me to explore let me know!
