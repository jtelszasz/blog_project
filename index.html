        <span class="smaller">February 4, 2016</span>
        <div><p>With the massive change in Baltimore Police Department arrests in 2015 I thought it might be worth investigating how each neighborhood was affected.  Thankfully it appears the <a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Public-Safety/BPD-Arrests/3i3v-ibrt">BPD arrest dataset on Open Baltimore</a> and the <a href="http://bniajfi.org">Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance “Vital Signs” composite dataset</a> use the same Census neighborhood definitions so we can look at the arrest rates in each neighborhood as it relates to the population and demograhpics.  I’ve mapped two indicators by neighbohood that you can toggle between: the percent change in the number of arrests from 2014 to 2015 and the change in the arrest rate per 1,000 people in each neighbohood from 2014 to 2015.  I’ve only included neighborhoods with more than 200 people in the population to try and remove some of the (numerically) noisier neighborhoods.  Like I mentioned in the <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/16/Marijuana-Policy-Only-Part-of-Drop-in-Arrests">last post</a>, these changes are not all directly tied to the change in marijuana policy; indeed it would be hard to imagine 10,000 fewer arrests in Baltimore, a drop of about 29%, due to marijuana policy alone.</p>

<p><strong>Select</strong> from the “Visible Layers” in the upper right corner which layer you want to view.  <br />
<strong>Hover</strong> over each neighborhood to get the arrest counts from 2013, 2014, and 2015.  <br />
<strong>Click</strong> on a neighborhood to get additional statistics about the arrests.</p>

        <div><p>When looking at Baltimore Police Department (BPD) arrest statistics it’s important to note that in Maryland possession of less than 10 grams of marijuana is no longer grounds for arrest, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/maryland-senate-expected-to-take-vote-on-decriminalizing-marijuana/2014/03/14/ca64eb28-ab22-11e3-98f6-8e3c562f9996_story.html?tid=a_inl">effective October 1, 2014</a>.  When looking at the drop in arrests from 2014 to 2015 we can at least expect to attribute a portion of the drop to the change in marijuana policy.  But exactly how much?</p>

My new look is a mashup of the <a href="https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll">Tufte</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rosario/kasper">Kasper</a> themes for Jekyll.  I’m a fan of <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Edward Tufte</a>’s work and I think the layout gives more flexibility in presenting data and analysis.

        <div><p>Just a quick note to highlight some recent publicity.</p>

<p>In June, Technical.ly was kind enough to again shine a light on some of my analysis, this time <a href="http://technical.ly/baltimore/2015/06/04/baltimore-blight-maps-ouazad-elszasz/">on vacant buildings and lots in Baltimore</a>.  <a href="http://plot.ly">Plot.ly</a> also <a href="https://plot.ly/ipython-notebooks/baltimore-vital-signs/">used my iPython notebook</a> for my <a href="http://bniajfi.org/">Baltimore Vital Signs</a> analysis as an example of how to use the tool.</p>

<p>This past Friday I participated in <a href="http://bniajfi.org/data_day/2015agenda/">Baltimore Data Day</a> hosted by <a href="http://bniajfi.org/">Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance</a> at University of Baltimore.  I was invited to contribute to a panel on civic technology and I sincerely hope someone, anyone, in the room gained something from it.  <a href="http://technical.ly/baltimore/2015/07/13/data-day-crime-data-bmoremapped-training-set/">Technical.ly</a> has a quick blurb about it as well as my quick glance at Baltimore police arrest data post-Freddie Gray.  Also be sure to check out Ryan Smith’s map work <a href="http://www.bmoremapped.com/">here</a> and stay tuned for his new crime map.</p>

<p><strong>Coming up July 28</strong>, I’ll be at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Transportation-Techies/events/222183536/">DC Transportation Techies meetup</a> which is making a cameo in Baltimore at the Hyatt Regency.</p>

<p>I’ve added all this stuff to <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/The-Work">The Work</a> page (upper left corner) as well as my slide deck from my <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Civic-Hacking-Meetup/events/222166589/">“Apps Are Not The Answer”</a> talk at <a href="http://www.hackbaltimore.org">Hack Baltimore</a>.</p>

        <span class="smaller">June 2, 2015</span>
        <div><p>Many small and midsize American cities have experienced decades of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrinking_cities_in_the_United_States">population shrinkage</a>, but as you can imagine, it’s not so easy to shrink the physical footprint of a city.   Compound this with the housing bubble burst a few years ago and significant wealth inequality and it’s no surprise that so many cities are wrestling with blight and abandonment.  Even though <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-12-06/news/bs-md-ci-srb-looks-ahead-20111202_1_mayor-stephanie-rawlings-blake-property-tax-rate-half-century-of-population-decline">SRB wants to bring in 10,000 new families</a>, there’s little chance the vacant property issue in Baltimore is going away anytime soon.</p>

<p>In addition to the safety hazard neglected structures can pose, vacant lots and buildings are magnets for <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-02-10/news/9201130233_1_vacant-buildings-abandoned-demolishes">serious</a> <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-08-07/news/bs-crime-vacants-20140806_1_property-crime-serious-crime-violent-crime">crime</a>, including <em>gang activity, drugs, murder, assault, and rape</em>.</p>

<p>In order to get a look at how blight is affecting Baltimore one pretty straightforward exercise is to map all of these abandoned buildings and parcels to see what the city looks like.  I did this in the <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Baltimore-Vacant-Houses-On-Citylab/">last post</a>, and this work has been <a href="http://technical.ly/baltimore/2012/08/09/15928-vacant-buildings-baltimore-city-map/">done before</a>.  It should come as no surprise to anyone living in Baltimore where the neighborhoods hardest hit with blight are.</p>

<p>But context is everything, and the story these data tells us about what it’s like to be a school-aged kid in Baltimore is harrowing. <strong>The analysis suggests that about 68% of all vacant buildings in Baltimore are within a quarter mile of a city school, while about 27% of all vacant parcel area is within the same distance.</strong></p>

<p>Below you’ll see just how rampant this issue is for children in Baltimore.  The map shows a quarter-mile radius around each city school and the vacant parcels (blue) and vacant buildings (orange) within those buffers (data from <a href="http://data.baltimorecity.gov">Open Baltimore</a>).</p>

        <span class="smaller">June 1, 2015</span>
        <div><p><a href="http://www.citylab.com/housing/2015/05/mapping-the-density-of-baltimores-vacant-housing-crisis/394196/">Citylab from The Atlantic</a> just bounced <a href="https://citiesblogger.wordpress.com/2015/05/27/the-urban-blight-that-is-baltimores-inner-city/">some work done</a> by an economist named Amine Ouazad that maps the density of vacant housing in Baltimore.  The data Ouazad used are from the American Community Survey from the U.S. Census Bureau and <a href="http://www.ouazad.com/Maps/Baltimore_Vacancies/index.html">this is the resulting map</a>.  Coincidently I had already been working with <a href="http://data.baltimorecity.gov">Open Baltimore’s</a>vacant building and lot data for a different analysis but I figured I could quickly respond to Ouazad’s map.</p>

<p>Perhaps it’s an artifact of the data used and the census tract samples, but a similar plot using data from <a href="http://data.baltimorecity.gov">Open Baltimore</a> shows more clearly the divides within the city.  One commenter named “Jack” on the Citylab post indicated that the map showed high concentrations basically throughout the city, including wealthier and more business-centric neighborhoods like Mt. Vernon/Belvedere, Inner Harbor, Canton, and Federal Hill - comprising what we in Baltimore like to call <a href="http://thebaltimorechop.com/tag/the-white-l/">“The White L.”</a>  On first glance at the Ouazad map my intuition agreed with Jack, and here’s what the Open Baltimore data actually look like.  There are two layers - a heat map and the actual vacant building footprints (in black) so when you zoom in you can see the actual vacant buildings.</p>

        <a href="/articles/15/Verizon-Wireless-Calculator"><h1 class="contrast">Verizon Wireless Cost Estimation</h1></a>
        <span class="smaller">May 21, 2015</span>
        <div><p>A few weeks ago, my 2-year contract came due for a phone upgrade.  Seeing as how I was on an iPhone 4 and Apple’s recent OS upgrades have sucked the life clean out of it, I was looking forward to purchasing a new phone with the hopes that the new one will last beyond the 2-year cycle.  I was going to purchase an iPhone 6, and I knew (or so I thought) what it would cost up front if I were to sign on a new 2-year contract.  Simple, straight-forward.  No sales pitches necessary.</p>

<p>Then I entered the Verizon Wireless store.</p>

<p>Within a few moments of arrival and signing in, my name was called and I was paired with a sales rep.  Whilst hovering over me, he quickly moved the conversation from the phone itself to something called the <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/support/verizon-edge-faqs/">Edge plan</a>.  I hadn’t bothered looking at the Edge plan before coming to the store - from the marketing material it seemed that it was targeted at customers interested in upgrading their phone more rapidly than every two years.  I do not count myself in that category, so I didn’t bother looking into it.</p>

<p>The salesman threw so many numbers at me that my head was spinning.  He was claiming that I could get some accessory package essentially for free by switching to the Edge program.  I couldn’t follow any of his logic, and I was only marginally clearer on the details when the manager attempted to explain the costs to me.  I walked out of the store frustrated and not wanting to commit there and then.</p>

<p>I figure I can’t have been the only Verizon customer to have experienced this recently.  In order to figure out what the actual costs were and whether I’d actually save money I made a quick calculator for my family and I to use.  I’m sharing it here in case it helps others.</p>

<p>It’s pretty simple for now, and assumes you aren’t taking the bait and trying to upgrade your phone more frequently than two years.  The white boxes are entry cells: select the phone you want, enter your typical monthly service costs, and enter the percent down payment on the phone you’d like to make if you’re considering the Edge program.  The box to the right gives your estimated monthly bill (bold black text) and the total cost over two years for your options (in bold red text).</p>

        <div><p>Here’s a small idea that I think would make the upcoming election cycle incrementally more bearable.</p>

<p>Politicians seemingly pick numbers, figures, statistics, and trends out of thin air.  This can be infuriating no matter where you fall on the political spectrum.  Why don’t we push politicians to post annotated transcripts of their speeches and debates that provide citations?  Surely they have an intern or two that they can promote from sticking signs on front lawns to transcribing and footnoting.  This would be a big step in the direction of transparency and a substantive way to keep politicians honest.</p>

<p><strong>I’d propose we call it the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23showyourwork&amp;src=typd">#ShowYourWork</a> campaign.</strong>  If elementary school kids can show their work on math problems and high schoolers can cite their references in English papers, surely our politicians can follow their lead.  Moreover, it would signal a commitment to and appreciation for the STEM fields that politicians like to pay lip service to when it comes to job growth.</p>

Unfortunately, they didn’t take a peek at the same open data for parking citations I’ve been investigating lately.</p>

<p>This road is a small two-way street in a quiet, wealthy neighborhood adjacent to the Johns Hopkins University campus called Keswick.  The street is narrow, and so vehicles typically park on either side with their tires past the curb which is illegal.  Apparently they also occasionally park on the left facing the wrong direction.</p>

<p>Start here in Google Street View and work your way north - the street is indeed quite narrow and most cars (save for maybe the Smart car) are parked with their two right tires over the curb.  The Smart car and several others are parked on the left side facing the wrong direction.</p>

<p>It’s uber-simple - just loops through all the csv’s in a directory, appends them to one Pandas dataframe, and saves the new csv.  It also tacks on the filenames of each file if separating into the original files is needed later.  This also assumes all the fields are named exactly the same in all the csv files.  Sure beats reading each individually and merging after.</p>

I’ve since gone back on my own time and learned more statisical inference through online coursework, and am taking a stab at some analysis and coding.</p>

        <div><p>Here’s a quick look using historical data to predict the future.  If the goal is to predict the next hour’s electricity consumption, a good predictor might be the consumption of the hour (or several hours) immediately prior.  One way to assess whether or not this is through the autocorrelation given by:</p>

<p>I’ll bring in the hourly outdoor temperature as measured at Baltimore-Washington International Airport (less than 10 miles away as the crow flies).  The data are obtained via the API at <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api">Weather Underground</a>.  Again, you can follow along my line (curve, circle, some other obscure geometry) of thinking by taking a look at the <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jtelszasz/my_energy/blob/master/My_Energy_And_Weather.ipynb?create=1">iPython notebook</a>.</p>
