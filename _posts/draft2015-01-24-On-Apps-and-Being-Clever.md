Steph knows all too well how quickly I can mount my high horse and take to moralizing.  Allow me to share that experience with you.

While reading and researching the citation data I came across an app that determines your risk of receiving a parking ticket based on your location and time of day.  It seems that Baltimore's city council became aware of its existence and was understandably perturbed.  In this rare scenario, I actually tend to agree with city council for the following reason:

## Not getting screwed shouldn't be dependent on whether or not you have the right app. 

If you have sufficient data and analysis to show that a policy is unfair then you have the ability to affect that change and anything less is a cop-out.  If you don't have sufficient data or analysis to prove this or choose not to voice policy concerns, then all you are really doing is gaming the system and exploiting loopholes. There is a difference between being smart and being clever, and I worry that too many in the tech world are the latter.

While it may be inevitable I don't think technology has rendered democracy wholly obsolete quite yet. It's most certainly happening.  But there are many who don't have access to the latest and greatest, and they'll be left behind if we move all of our democractic policy decisions to the interwebs.
