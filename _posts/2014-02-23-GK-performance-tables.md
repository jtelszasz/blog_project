In 2012, Manchester City FC and Opta (a sports analytics company) teamed up to release a season's worth of granular data for the 2011-2012 season. Two datasets were released - one with 206 fields containing total game events by player, and another that included x-y locations for passes and shots for each player over the course of the entire season.

Since I'm a goalkeeper, I became interested in measuring the performance of goalkeepers. Having surveyed a number of soccer analytics blogs, goalkeeping seems to be a lesser researched topic and is also potentially more difficult to analyze given the smaller number of events or actions a goalkeeper might take over the course of a game compared to field players.

To kick things off, I've provided some quick and hopefully useful stat tables for the overall season numbers for goalkeepers. I'm only looking at goalkeepers who played 1080 minutes or more (12 games) so we have a reasonable sample size for each goalkeeper. I'll get to some potential visualizations later, but for now these stats are simple enough that ordered lists are a clear enough way to see some performance metrics. I'm actively choosing not to go the bar graph route.
