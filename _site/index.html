    <p><a href="http://www.citylab.com/housing/2015/05/mapping-the-density-of-baltimores-vacant-housing-crisis/394196/">Citylab from The Atlantic</a> just bounced <a href="https://citiesblogger.wordpress.com/2015/05/27/the-urban-blight-that-is-baltimores-inner-city/">some work done</a> by an economist named Amine Ouazad that maps the density of vacant housing in Baltimore.  The data Ouazad used are from the American Community Survey from the U.S. Census Bureau and <a href="http://www.ouazad.com/Maps/Baltimore_Vacancies/index.html">this is the resulting map</a>.  Coincidently I had already been working with <a href="http://data.baltimorecity.gov">Open Baltimore’s</a>vacant building and lot data for a different analysis but I figured I could quickly respond to Ouazad’s map.</p>

<p>Perhaps it’s an artifact of the data used and the census tract samples, but a similar plot using data from <a href="http://data.baltimorecity.gov">Open Baltimore</a> shows more clearly the divides within the city.  One commenter named “Jack” on the Citylab post indicated that the map showed high concentrations basically throughout the city, including wealthier and more business-centric neighborhoods like Mt. Vernon/Belvedere, Inner Harbor, Canton, and Federal Hill - comprising what we in Baltimore like to call <a href="http://thebaltimorechop.com/tag/the-white-l/">“The White L.”</a>  On first glance at the Ouazad map my intuition agreed with Jack, and here’s what the Open Baltimore data actually look like.  There are two layers - a heat map and the actual vacant building footprints (in black) so when you zoom in you can see the actual vacant buildings.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>A few weeks ago, my 2-year contract came due for a phone upgrade.  Seeing as how I was on an iPhone 4 and Apple’s recent OS upgrades have sucked the life clean out of it, I was looking forward to purchasing a new phone with the hopes that the new one will last beyond the 2-year cycle.  I was going to purchase an iPhone 6, and I knew (or so I thought) what it would cost up front if I were to sign on a new 2-year contract.  Simple, straight-forward.  No sales pitches necessary.</p>

<p>Then I entered the Verizon Wireless store.</p>

<p>Within a few moments of arrival and signing in, my name was called and I was paired with a sales rep.  Whilst hovering over me, he quickly moved the conversation from the phone itself to something called the <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/support/verizon-edge-faqs/">Edge plan</a>.  I hadn’t bothered looking at the Edge plan before coming to the store - from the marketing material it seemed that it was targeted at customers interested in upgrading their phone more rapidly than every two years.  I do not count myself in that category, so I didn’t bother looking into it.</p>

<p>The salesman threw so many numbers at me that my head was spinning.  He was claiming that I could get some accessory package essentially for free by switching to the Edge program.  I couldn’t follow any of his logic, and I was only marginally clearer on the details when the manager attempted to explain the costs to me.  I walked out of the store frustrated and not wanting to commit there and then.</p>

<p>I figure I can’t have been the only Verizon customer to have experienced this recently.  In order to figure out what the actual costs were and whether I’d actually save money I made a quick calculator for my family and I to use.  I’m sharing it here in case it helps others.  </p>

<p>It’s pretty simple for now, and assumes you aren’t taking the bait and trying to upgrade your phone more frequently than two years.  The white boxes are entry cells: select the phone you want, enter your typical monthly service costs, and enter the percent down payment on the phone you’d like to make if you’re considering the Edge program.  The box to the right gives your estimated monthly bill (bold black text) and the total cost over two years for your options (in bold red text).</p>

    <p>I’ll be giving a couple of talks in Baltimore in the next two weeks.  Would love for you to attend if you’re in the area!  Click on the title of the talk below to RSVP through Meetup.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Civic-Hacking-Meetup/events/222166589/"> “Apps Are Not The Answer” on Thursday May 14 @ DreamIt Health Baltimore.</a></strong>  I’ll describe how I’ve tried to engage city officials and journalists in order to address policy, problem-solving, and decision-making. I’ll be sharing examples of my work, as well as some reminders of the principles that should guide problem-solving, applied science, and engineering. Hosted by <a href="http://www.hackbaltimore.org">Hack Baltimore</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.meetup.com/baltimore-python/events/221252779/">“Bad Ass(umptions)” on Wednesday May 20 @ Social Growth Technologies in Columbia, MD.”</a></strong>  I’ll examine the false premises and assumptions that I’ve made and subsequently obliterated through my data analysis work on The Training Set.  Hosted by <a href="http://www.meetup.com/baltimore-python/">the Baltimore Python crew</a>.</p>

    <p>The city <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-ci-freddie-gray-officers-20150421-story.html">released the names of the six officers involved in Freddie Gray’s arrest and subsequent death</a>.</p>

<p>Below is how much each of them earned in fiscal year 2014 based on <a href="http://data.baltimorecity.gov">Open Baltimore</a> data.</p>

</figure>
</center>

<p>The six officers have been suspended <strong>with pay</strong>.  Assuming a 40 hour work week and 48 working weeks in the year, below are these officers’ hourly wages, daily wages, and assuming a 50% ratio of salary for benefits and insurance (typical assumption for wage calculations), the six officers are costing Baltimore City taxpayers $2,151.44 every day of their suspension.  Today is April 26 and as far as I can tell from <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/21/freddie-gray-death-baltimore-officers-suspended_n_7105368.html">the earliest Associated Press announcement</a> of their suspension, the officers have been suspended for six days, so the <strong>current bill to taxpayers is $12,908.63 and counting</strong>.</p>

    <p>As if the police haven’t been in the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23blacklivesmatter&amp;src=typd">public eye</a> enough lately, Baltimore Brew has been <a href="https://www.baltimorebrew.com/2015/03/26/police-overtime-declines-but-is-still-targeted-to-reach-record/">beating the drum</a> regarding police overtime budget.  According to the Brew’s reporting, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake promised tax cuts for residents that would be paid for by incoming tax revenue from the casino.  The mayor <a href="https://www.baltimorebrew.com/2015/04/13/its-now-official-sagging-casino-revenues-equal-no-property-tax-cut-this-year/">recently announced</a>, however, that these cuts would not come to fruition as planned, since revenues from the casino are <a href="https://www.baltimorebrew.com/2015/03/25/horseshoe-casino-will-pay-only-4-million-in-lease-revenues-this-year/">nowhere near the levels predicted</a>.  Meanwhile, police are able to rake in sweet, sweet overtime pay by providing a security detail at the casino.  We won’t be able to see the resulting change in overtime due to the casino yet since it opened in FY2015, but in the meantime it’s worth scrutinizing Baltimore police overtime and bonus closely given the broader discussion of cost-effectiveness in policing.</p>

<p>In fact, <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-06-30/news/bs-md-ci-baltimore-overtime-20100602_1_overtime-earners-deputy-mayor-christopher-thomaskutty-councilwoman-belinda-conaway">concerns about overtime pay predate</a> the data we have through Open Baltimore, though older data might be available in <a href="http://data.baltimoresun.com/salary_database/">other forms</a>.</p>

<p>To aid our investigation, <a href="http://data.baltimorecity.gov">Open Baltimore</a> publishes annual salary and gross pay data for all of its employees.  </p>

<h2 id="salary--overtime-analysis">Salary &amp; Overtime Analysis</h2>

<p>I filtered the city salary data down to just the police department, and from there broke out a few different groups of police employees where we might be interested in changes in overtime pay.  The calculations I employ are as follows:</p>

<p>Police officers are coded in the datasets as “Police Officer” or “Police Officer (EID).”  I’m not sure what “(EID)” stands for but they are certainly cops on the payroll.  Police officers in training are another possibility, but I am not including them in the list of actual officers for this analysis.</p>

<h2 id="furloughs">2011: Furloughs</h2>

<p>As so often happens to me when I’m plugging along on an analysis, I hit a snag, and have to backtrack to find out what’s going on.  More often than not, I retrace my steps and discover some strange artifact or issue in the city’s data.  This was the case here as well.</p>

<p>One of my starting assumptions was that I should filter out any officers whose gross pay was less than their annual salary.  Well, it turns out that this was a majority of the Baltimore Police Department in FY2011, so that’s a bad idea.</p>

<center>

  <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/2015-04/BPD_Gross_Pay_Ratio_2011.png"><img src="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/2015-04/BPD_Gross_Pay_Ratio_2011.png" /></a>
</figure>
</center>

<p>Half of the BPD made less than 95% of their reported annual salary in 2011.  What gives?  After a little digging, I found <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-01-07/news/bs-md-police-pay-cuts-20110107_1_robert-f-cherry-police-officers-bob-sledgeski">this article</a> and I think I have an answer: furloughs.  No doubt that situation must have been rough, but based on the analysis below they’ve made up for it over the last couple years.  In fact, the results below show that officers themselves didn’t bear the brunt of the hit - others in the BPD did.  I’m happy to be wrong and invite any Baltimore city officials to slice this a different way and let me know why 2011 payouts were smaller than salaries, but it doesn’t seem like this is a data quality issue.</p>

<hr />

<p>The following are some metrics for a few different slices of the BPD.</p>

<h2 id="all-police">All Police</h2>

<p>The furloughs in 2011 obviously stick out here, but what we don’t have is information on what overtime and bonuses were like before 2011 and the recession.  </p>

<p>Generally though, this certainly sets the backdrop for concerns regarding overtime pay that may be occuring at the casino.  Overtime payout has swelled to $30 million for each of the last two years and that’s without the casino.  Will the total overtime paid increase beyond $30 million for FY2015?  Or will the overtime budget stay the same, with overtime duties getting shifted from one location or another to the casino?  Neither sounds like a good idea.</p>

</figure>
</center>

<h2 id="police-officers">Police Officers</h2>

<p>What’s interesting here is that while the total bonus/overtime in 2011 was negative (furloughs) for all BPD, officers’ officers in general still made on average a $1,012 bonus, to the tune of more than $2 million for all officers.  In the next section, you’ll see that the <strong>rest of the department took a $3 million hit</strong> on gross pay, resulting in the -$1 million total bonus/overtime in 2011 for the whole police department shown above.  It’s worth reminding ourselves here that police unions are a political force to be reckoned with.</p>

</figure>
</center>

<h2 id="other-police-department-not-officers">Other Police Department (Not Officers)</h2>

<p>On average salaries for non-officers in the BPD are comparable to police officers.  But of course, they make nowhere near the overtime and bonus available to officers.  <strong>Compare the 19%-of-salary bonus in 2014 for police officers above to the 2%-of-salary bonus for non-officers in 2014.</strong></p>

</figure>
</center>

<h2 id="top-20-bonus-earners">Top 20 Bonus Earners</h2>

<p>Here’s what the top of the food chain looks like for the department.  Of course, these police employees didn’t have to worry during the recession - <strong>their average bonus when the department was suffering in 2011   was $52,827.  On average, the sizes of their bonuses were equal to their salary for fiscal years 2012 through 2014.</strong></p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>The Horseshoe Casino.</strong>  We’ll have to wait until the FY2015 data are released over at <a href="http://data.baltimorecity.gov">Open Baltimore</a> in order to see what impact it has on bonuses/overtime.</li>
  <li><strong>Correlating bonus/overtime pay with crime/arrests.</strong>  All else being equal, in a democracy our tax funds are supposed to go to the people’s priorities.  We should be having an open discussion about whether it is more important to fund overtime and bonus for incentivizing good policing or to hire more police and fund better training.  Neither option has an <em>a priori</em> claim to efficacy, and we should be looking for empirical methods to show where to allocate funds.  We can try correlating crime and arrest data with these police salary data and see where we get.  Wearing my scientist/analyst/reporter hat, I’ll try to remain skeptical and neutral, but to be honest <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/548/transcript">my money is on better training.</a></li>

    <p>Here’s a small idea that I think would make the upcoming election cycle incrementally more bearable.  </p>

<p>Politicians seemingly pick numbers, figures, statistics, and trends out of thin air.  This can be infuriating no matter where you fall on the political spectrum.  Why don’t we push politicians to post annotated transcripts of their speeches and debates that provide citations?  Surely they have an intern or two that they can promote from sticking signs on front lawns to transcribing and footnoting.  This would be a big step in the direction of transparency and a substantive way to keep politicians honest.</p>

<p><strong>I’d propose we call it the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23showyourwork&amp;src=typd">#ShowYourWork</a> campaign.</strong>  If elementary school kids can show their work on math problems and high schoolers can cite their references in English papers, surely our politicians can follow their lead.  Moreover, it would signal a commitment to and appreciation for the STEM fields that politicians like to pay lip service to when it comes to job growth.</p>

    <p>It’s no secret that most American cities are segregated.</p>

<p>When I tell people I live in Baltimore, that I love living there and that it’s a great American city, what I really mean is that the neighborhoods I typically experience are great.  Baltimore of course has its many ills, and it’s very easy for white, college-educated individuals like myself to find themselves experiencing a very different reality than most in the city.</p>

<p>There are many socio-economic variables that would describe such segregation - something I hinted at with the <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Know-More-Bmore">last post</a>.  Luckily, the<a href="http://www.bniajfi.org/indicators"> Baltimore Neighborhoods Indicators Alliance - Jacob France Institute (BNIA)</a> at the University of Baltimore has made it their mission to provide a clean, concise set of indicators that illustrate the health and wealth of the city.  There are 152 socio-economic indicators in the Vital Signs dataset, and some are reported for multiple years which results in 295 total variables for each of the 56 Baltimore neighborhoods captured.  For this analysis, I’m throwing them all in the mixer.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, many of the variables are strongly correlated with each other (e.g. the percent of the population in a neighborhood that is white is inversely proportional to the percent that aren’t white, so you don’t necessarily need both depending on what you’re trying to do with the data).  Rather than try plotting all of these variables against one another, it’s possible to illustrate the degree to which the city is segregated by distilling the 295 variables into only a couple - in other words, teasing out the principal socio-economic “directions” in which communities may be close or far from each other.</p>

<p>(If you want to know the technical details of the analysis, check out the link at the bottom of this post to the iPython notebook.  For the sake of anyone reading this I’ll try and minimize the jargon and explain some of the analysis below the result.)</p>

<p><strong>This is the key: by reducing the 295 dimensions in the dataset to only two, we can visualize a socio-economic map of the city. Neighborhoods farther apart on the map are socio-economically dissimilar and neighborhoods close to one another on the map are socio-economically similar.</strong></p>

<p>On the plot below, each bubble is a neighborhood in Baltimore and is sized by the population living in that neighborhood.  One can delineate groups or “clusters” of neighborhoods.  These are clusters of neighborhoods that are more socio-economically similar.  We can specify a number of clusters and using an algorithm (K-means clustering, described below) we can find the best way to divide the neighborhoods into clusters; each color represents a different cluster and the X’s are the centers of each cluster.  The number of clusters I’ve chosen (seven) is somewhat arbitrary.  No axes labels are shown since the actual values output from the principal component analysis (discussed below) are meaningless.</p>

<p>What results is effectively a socio-economic map of Baltimore.  Use your cursor to hover over each bubble to see the name of the neighborhood.  <strong>Again, the farther apart one bubble is from another, the more socio-economically dissimilar those neighborhoods are.</strong>  For example, find the “Inner Harbor/Federal Hill” (upper right, grey) and “Greater Rosemont” (West Baltimore, adjacent to Gwynn Falls Park; lower left, light blue) neighborhoods.</p>

<p><em>“Wait, there are seven clusters but I’m only counting six different colors.”</em> </p>

<p>There’s one point that is its own cluster and it isn’t shown - it’s the “Downtown” neighborhood, and it was a clear outlier.  I’ll dig into this point and see what’s going on, but my guess is that it has to do with the fact that the area is nearly all business and hardly any residences.  </p>

<h2 id="principle-component-analysis">Principle Component Analysis</h2>

<p>We can reduce the number of variables using a technique known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</a>.  PCA reduces the full set of data (the variables of which may be correlated) to uncorrelated, or orthogonal, directions.  (Math folks: these are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.)  You can choose the number of dimensions in which you’d like to represent your data - the first dimension chosen will account for the most variance in the data, the next dimension (2nd principal axis) will account for the second highest portion of variance, and so on.  </p>

<p>To steal an analogy from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Greene">Brian Greene</a> on the topic of reducing higher dimensions (I think this was in The Elegant Universe), imagine an ant on a stretched out piece of rope.  From a far away distance, we would likely identify the position of the ant only in terms of its distance from one end of the rope.  If we zoom in closely though, we could describe the ant’s location in two dimensions: both its distance from one end of the rope and its location circumferentially around the rope (a third possible dimension would be the ant’s radial distance from the centerline axis of the rope, but that’s virtually constant unless the ant jumps off the rope).  This same concept can be applied for reducing higher dimensional data in order to visualize relationships in data.  </p>

<p>We want to reduce the 295 variables in the Vital Signs dataset to two since we want to visualize this in a 2-D scatter plot.</p>

<h2 id="k-means-clustering">K-Means Clustering</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">K-means clustering</a> is an algorithm that groups data points into clusters.  One could do this manually, but this algorithm automates the process by minimizing the distances from each data points to the center (centroid) of the cluster.  However, one has to specify the number of clusters for the algorithm to use.  One can imagine that to minimize the distances from each data point to the cluster center, one could set the number of clusters equal to the number of data points, i.e. each point is its own cluster, but this is a trivial solution.  Using a metric (called inertia) that measures the typical distance from points to centers, the algorithm can be run multiple times, each time using a different number of clusters, to try and achieve an acceptable result for the inertia.  I chose seven after plotting the inertia as a function of number of clusters.  This plot can be found in the iPython notebook (link below).</p>

    <p>I was able to get in contact with Edward Ericson Jr. over at Baltimore’s City Paper concerning the <a href="http://www.citypaper.com/news/mobtownbeat/bcp-victims-of-a-unique-baltimore-parking-problem-fight-the-law-and-the-law-wins-20141216,0,5288351.story">parking investigation at 4200 Wickford Rd</a>.  Ed was kind enough to bounce my findings in a <a href="http://www.citypaper.com/blogs/the-news-hole/bcp-wandering-eye-a-neonoir-crime-blotter-date-on-parking-in-baltimore-and-more-20150305,0,1269875.story">quick update blurb</a>.  Full text is below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Parking being what it is in Baltimore, it’s not surprising that a light-hearted look at the lengths city councilmembers are required to go on behalf of constituents who are inconvenienced by tickets—which City Paper published in December—would be met by data hounds. Now comes Justin Elszasz, who analyzed the city’s parking ticket database to conclude that—surprise—the issue is not so big, in the grand scheme of things. “What is curious is that the open data for parking citations at the 4200 block of Wickford Rd. are not showing a rampant citation issue as the article or residents suggest,” the blog post says, above a bar graph depicting more than 20 citations in April of 2014 and 15 in November-December. But the data looks like exactly the sort of thing the residents complained (and CP wrote) about—sporatic, complaint-driven hard-assery. We were careful not to quantify the damage because we did not have the tools or time to do the analysis Elszasz did. And he confirms what City Paper reported, right down to our tone. We said the residents—who actually have garages on their back alley—are inconvenienced by the law prohibiting them from parking on the curb, facing the wrong way. Elszasz says: “It truly pales in comparison to some of the blocks I’ve been looking at recently. The article claims that parking tickets have appeared in the middle of the night, ‘depicting the parking enforcement agents as thieves in the night.’ It looks like that actually was the case a couple few times - around 4:30am on April 4 and 8, 2014, and around 2:30am on April 18, 2014. But overall, this article and the residents on this block appear to be making something out of nothing. The grand total of fines issued for the 41 citations above is $1,312.” - Edward Ericson Jr.</p>
