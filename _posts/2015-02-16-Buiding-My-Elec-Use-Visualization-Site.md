This is just a quick blurb to say I'm building a new page for my website for visualizing my electricity usage data.  You can find it in the upper left menu panel by clicking on "<a href='{{ site.url }}/my-elec-use/'>My Electricity Use</a>."  Right now I've just got an interactive heat map up for the hourly data (based on this post).  I'm admittedly slow to the <a href='http://plot.ly'>Plotly</a> game, but I'll be using it a lot more regularly going forward.
