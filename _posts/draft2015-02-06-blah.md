Now that we can be sure of having a <a href='{{ site.url }}/articles/Quick-Response-From-Baltimore-Chief-Data-Officer'>complete data set</a> for the immediately preceding two years, we can take a closer look at parking citation policies and compliance.

Since the <a href='http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/sun-investigates/bs-md-speed-camera-hearing-20141201-story.html'>traffic camera program ended in Baltimore in 2013</a> it appears enforcement policies have taken a dramatic turn to make up the lost revenue.  Moreover, judging by the spike this past December, I'd hazard a guess that either year-end budgets were looking tight or that goals or quotas had been set at the beginning of the year and were not being met.

## Can we tell anything about enforcement policy?

Of course.  Between January 20, 2013 and January 20, 2015, citations were issued at 38,597 unique locations.  **1.2% of those locations account for 45.8% of the total value of fines issued.**  What were target locations?  Here are the top 20 locations in terms of total fines issued.
