In a recent posts I've shown particular blocks that became targets for parking enforcement.  The short five block stretch on North Charlest Street right around the corner from my apartment is one of those target locations.

So when is that stretch being targeted?  Here are the hourly total citation counts for those five blocks on North Charles St.  Looks like you're safe before 10am on the weekends, and maybe have a shot if you need a quick spot around 3pm.

You're also probably safer on Sundays.

## DOT & Baltimore IT Should Provide New Citation Description Options

Of course as we've seen in the past, parking police are using the "All Other Parking Meter Violations" predominantly, which masks the true cause of the citation.  In this instance, these are metered parking spots so my guess is their time has expired.  This is something that DOT and Baltimore Mayor's Office of IT could easily provide a new description code for so we know that this is the cause.
