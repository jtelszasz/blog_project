### Baltimore OpenData 

Baltimore City publishes several datasets on <a href="http://data.baltimorecity.gov">OpenBaltimore</a>, one of which is timestamped arrest data from the police department for 2013 (until September).  There aren't any such datasets on the website for previous years, and the <a href="http:// www.ucrdatatool.gov/">FBI Uniform Crime Reporting tool</a> only offers annual numbers.  Of course looking at different time resolutions can help answer different questions about how policies are working, and I don't think I've gotten to see timestamped data for arrests like these before.  I'm used to hearing politicians or policy wonks quoting annual crime stats.  So here's what daily total arrests look like in Baltimore.  I also found the same dataset for <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org">Chicago</a>, the differences being that while Baltimore only posts data for *arrests* for 2013 (last updated in September, at that), Chicago offers all *arrest and non-arrest* timestamped records back to 2001 (a total of over 5 million records).  I've plotted Chicago's arrest data alongside the Baltimore numbers by means of comparison.

### Keep Holy The Sabbath

What clearly stands out is the striking drop in arrests on Sundays.
