When I inform people that I commute from Baltimore to DC every day for work, the general response is one of either pity or disgust. But by taking the commuter train every day, I avoid two things that are very important to me: 1) living in Washington, DC and 2) driving anywhere near the DC beltway.  Moreover, I've effectively built in two hours every day to focus on whatever I choose.  Although reading, podcasts and other media are entertaining filler, after a short time I decided rather to spend my time productively.  This blog is the product of my efforts during my commute to learn more about data analysis techniques during my train commute.  

### Me

My name is Justin, and by education and background I'm a mechanical engineer.  I help write energy efficiency policy for the U.S. Department of Energy but am also interested in data analytics and urban planning.  I use this blog as a means for exploring and researching topics I find interesting.  If you have ideas, data, questions, or problems hit me up!

I did *not* design the website.  I'm using a gorgeous Jekyll template called <a href='http://mademistakes.com/articles/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/'>Minimal Mistakes</a> designed by <a href='https://twitter.com/mmistakes'>Michael Rose</a>.  You can find his other work at <a href='http://www.mademistakes.com'>Made Mistakes</a>.
