My name is Justin, and by education and background I'm a mechanical engineer.  I help write energy efficiency policy for the U.S. Department of Energy but I'm also interested in data analytics.  I use this blog as a means for exploring and researching topics I find interesting.  If you have ideas, data, questions, or problems hit me up!

I did *not* design the website.  I'm using a gorgeous Jekyll template designed by <a href='https://twitter.com/mmistakes'>Michael Rose</a>.  You can find his other work at <a href='http://www.mademistakes.com'>Made Mistakes</a>.
