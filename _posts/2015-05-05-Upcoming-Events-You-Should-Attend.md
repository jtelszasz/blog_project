I'll be giving a couple of talks in Baltimore in the next two weeks.  Would love for you to attend if you're in the area!  Click on the title of the talk below to RSVP through Meetup.

**<a href='http://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Civic-Hacking-Meetup/events/222166589/'> "Apps Are Not The Answer" on Thursday May 14 @ DreamIt Health Baltimore.</a>**  I'll describe how I've tried to engage city officials and journalists in order to address policy, problem-solving, and decision-making. I'll be sharing examples of my work, as well as some reminders of the principles that should guide problem-solving, applied science, and engineering. Hosted by <a href='http://www.hackbaltimore.org'>Hack Baltimore</a>.

**<a href='http://www.meetup.com/baltimore-python/events/221252779/'>"Bad Ass(umptions) on Wednesday May 20 @ Social Growth Technologies in Columbia, MD."</a>**  I'll examine the false premises and assumptions that I've made and subsequently obliterated through my data analysis work on The Training Set.  Hosted by <a href='http://www.meetup.com/baltimore-python/'>the Baltimore Python crew</a>.
