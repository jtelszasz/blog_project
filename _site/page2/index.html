    <p>It’s no secret that most American cities are segregated.</p>

<p>When I tell people I live in Baltimore, that I love living there and that it’s a great American city, what I really mean is that the neighborhoods I typically experience are great.  Baltimore of course has its many ills, and it’s very easy for white, college-educated individuals like myself to find themselves experiencing a very different reality than most in the city.</p>

<p>There are many socio-economic variables that would describe such segregation - something I hinted at with the <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Know-More-Bmore">last post</a>.  Luckily, the<a href="http://www.bniajfi.org/indicators"> Baltimore Neighborhoods Indicators Alliance - Jacob France Institute (BNIA)</a> at the University of Baltimore has made it their mission to provide a clean, concise set of indicators that illustrate the health and wealth of the city.  There are 152 socio-economic indicators in the Vital Signs dataset, and some are reported for multiple years which results in 295 total variables for each of the 56 Baltimore neighborhoods captured.  For this analysis, I’m throwing them all in the mixer.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, many of the variables are strongly correlated with each other (e.g. the percent of the population in a neighborhood that is white is inversely proportional to the percent that aren’t white, so you don’t necessarily need both depending on what you’re trying to do with the data).  Rather than try plotting all of these variables against one another, it’s possible to illustrate the degree to which the city is segregated by distilling the 295 variables into only a couple - in other words, teasing out the principal socio-economic “directions” in which communities may be close or far from each other.</p>

<p>(If you want to know the technical details of the analysis, check out the link at the bottom of this post to the iPython notebook.  For the sake of anyone reading this I’ll try and minimize the jargon and explain some of the analysis below the result.)</p>

<p><strong>This is the key: by reducing the 295 dimensions in the dataset to only two, we can visualize a socio-economic map of the city. Neighborhoods farther apart on the map are socio-economically dissimilar and neighborhoods close to one another on the map are socio-economically similar.</strong></p>

<p>On the plot below, each bubble is a neighborhood in Baltimore and is sized by the population living in that neighborhood.  One can delineate groups or “clusters” of neighborhoods.  These are clusters of neighborhoods that are more socio-economically similar.  We can specify a number of clusters and using an algorithm (K-means clustering, described below) we can find the best way to divide the neighborhoods into clusters; each color represents a different cluster and the X’s are the centers of each cluster.  The number of clusters I’ve chosen (seven) is somewhat arbitrary.  No axes labels are shown since the actual values output from the principal component analysis (discussed below) are meaningless.</p>

<p>What results is effectively a socio-economic map of Baltimore.  Use your cursor to hover over each bubble to see the name of the neighborhood.  <strong>Again, the farther apart one bubble is from another, the more socio-economically dissimilar those neighborhoods are.</strong>  For example, find the “Inner Harbor/Federal Hill” (upper right, grey) and “Greater Rosemont” (West Baltimore, adjacent to Gwynn Falls Park; lower left, light blue) neighborhoods.</p>

<p><em>“Wait, there are seven clusters but I’m only counting six different colors.”</em> </p>

<p>There’s one point that is its own cluster and it isn’t shown - it’s the “Downtown” neighborhood, and it was a clear outlier.  I’ll dig into this point and see what’s going on, but my guess is that it has to do with the fact that the area is nearly all business and hardly any residences.  </p>

<h2 id="principle-component-analysis">Principle Component Analysis</h2>

<p>We can reduce the number of variables using a technique known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</a>.  PCA reduces the full set of data (the variables of which may be correlated) to uncorrelated, or orthogonal, directions.  (Math folks: these are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.)  You can choose the number of dimensions in which you’d like to represent your data - the first dimension chosen will account for the most variance in the data, the next dimension (2nd principal axis) will account for the second highest portion of variance, and so on.  </p>

<p>To steal an analogy from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Greene">Brian Greene</a> on the topic of reducing higher dimensions (I think this was in The Elegant Universe), imagine an ant on a stretched out piece of rope.  From a far away distance, we would likely identify the position of the ant only in terms of its distance from one end of the rope.  If we zoom in closely though, we could describe the ant’s location in two dimensions: both its distance from one end of the rope and its location circumferentially around the rope (a third possible dimension would be the ant’s radial distance from the centerline axis of the rope, but that’s virtually constant unless the ant jumps off the rope).  This same concept can be applied for reducing higher dimensional data in order to visualize relationships in data.  </p>

<p>We want to reduce the 295 variables in the Vital Signs dataset to two since we want to visualize this in a 2-D scatter plot.</p>

<h2 id="k-means-clustering">K-Means Clustering</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">K-means clustering</a> is an algorithm that groups data points into clusters.  One could do this manually, but this algorithm automates the process by minimizing the distances from each data points to the center (centroid) of the cluster.  However, one has to specify the number of clusters for the algorithm to use.  One can imagine that to minimize the distances from each data point to the cluster center, one could set the number of clusters equal to the number of data points, i.e. each point is its own cluster, but this is a trivial solution.  Using a metric (called inertia) that measures the typical distance from points to centers, the algorithm can be run multiple times, each time using a different number of clusters, to try and achieve an acceptable result for the inertia.  I chose seven after plotting the inertia as a function of number of clusters.  This plot can be found in the iPython notebook (link below).</p>

    <p>I took a quick look at the Vital Signs dataset from the<a href="http://www.bniajfi.org/indicators"> Baltimore Neighborhoods Indicators Alliance - Jacob France Institute (BNIA)</a> at the University of Baltimore (data also available at <a href="http://data.baltimorecity.gov/">Open Baltimore</a>) and created some <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/">Hans Rosling-style plots</a>.</p>

<p>These are clean datasets of socio-economic indicators derived from the U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey and Baltimore agencies, among other sources.  The BNIA has built a <a href="http://bniajfi.org/vital_signs/">website for mapping data</a> and they were rightly lauded for cleaning and opening up this data for public use, but I’ve seen only a handful of analyses based on the Vital Signs datasets.</p>

    <p>I was able to get in contact with Edward Ericson Jr. over at Baltimore’s City Paper concerning the <a href="http://www.citypaper.com/news/mobtownbeat/bcp-victims-of-a-unique-baltimore-parking-problem-fight-the-law-and-the-law-wins-20141216,0,5288351.story">parking investigation at 4200 Wickford Rd</a>.  Ed was kind enough to bounce my findings in a <a href="http://www.citypaper.com/blogs/the-news-hole/bcp-wandering-eye-a-neonoir-crime-blotter-date-on-parking-in-baltimore-and-more-20150305,0,1269875.story">quick update blurb</a>.  Full text is below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Parking being what it is in Baltimore, it’s not surprising that a light-hearted look at the lengths city councilmembers are required to go on behalf of constituents who are inconvenienced by tickets—which City Paper published in December—would be met by data hounds. Now comes Justin Elszasz, who analyzed the city’s parking ticket database to conclude that—surprise—the issue is not so big, in the grand scheme of things. “What is curious is that the open data for parking citations at the 4200 block of Wickford Rd. are not showing a rampant citation issue as the article or residents suggest,” the blog post says, above a bar graph depicting more than 20 citations in April of 2014 and 15 in November-December. But the data looks like exactly the sort of thing the residents complained (and CP wrote) about—sporatic, complaint-driven hard-assery. We were careful not to quantify the damage because we did not have the tools or time to do the analysis Elszasz did. And he confirms what City Paper reported, right down to our tone. We said the residents—who actually have garages on their back alley—are inconvenienced by the law prohibiting them from parking on the curb, facing the wrong way. Elszasz says: “It truly pales in comparison to some of the blocks I’ve been looking at recently. The article claims that parking tickets have appeared in the middle of the night, ‘depicting the parking enforcement agents as thieves in the night.’ It looks like that actually was the case a couple few times - around 4:30am on April 4 and 8, 2014, and around 2:30am on April 18, 2014. But overall, this article and the residents on this block appear to be making something out of nothing. The grand total of fines issued for the 41 citations above is $1,312.” - Edward Ericson Jr.</p>

    <p>The Baltimore citation open data also includes a field for open balance, meaning the amount still owed to the city for each citation.</p>

<p>With this information we can look at the rates of unpaid citations by citation type.  Below I’ve calculated these ratios for all description types, but have only included for comparison those categories that had more than 100 citations in the database (so we hopefully have meaningful comparisons).</p>

<!--The red light violations, however, should be of particular concern since they pose a safety risk.  While many of us in Baltimore have independently come to the same conclusion that the red lights are poorly timed, this does not excuse ignoring them.  The fact that red light violations have a higher portion of unpaid citations seems to indicate that the perhaps a stiffer penalty increase is warranted in order to curb this behavior.-->

<h2 id="another-suggestion-for-baltimore-dot-and-mayors-office-of-it">Another suggestion for Baltimore DOT and Mayor’s Office of IT</h2>

<p>The dataset that gets posted on <a href="http://data.baltimorecity.gov">the Open Baltimore data portal</a> could really use better documenatation.  Here’s another example of why.  Since the speed camera program was halted in Baltimore, certain citations are no longer captured by this dataset, since parking enforcers don’t issue any kind of moving violations.  Some of those types are still in this dataset, however - a hold over from when the camera program was still in effect.  They should be removed before any analysis or comparisons.  </p>

    <p>Here’s a suggestion directed at the Department of Transportation for improving their citation system.  </p>

<p>I’ve alluded to this in previous posts, but this should make it clear as day.  Looking at all citations since February of 2013, the category “All Other Parking Meter Violations” trumps all of the other citation types by a wide margin.  My guess is that, given its prominence, these are citations for time expiring on a parking meter.  But why code it as “all other?”  An “other” option should be a last resort, when all other codes don’t apply.  If parking enforcers are having to use this code so extensively, it suggests that they need more nuanced options for coding parking infringements.  This is essentially information about parking in the city that’s up for grabs and we’re leaving it on the table.</p>

    <p>In a recent post I’ve shown particular blocks that became targets for parking enforcement.  The short five block stretch on North Charles Street right around the corner from my apartment is one of those target locations.</p>

<p>So when is that stretch being targeted?  Here are the hourly total citation counts for those five blocks on North Charles St.  Looks like you’re safe before 10am on the weekends, and maybe have a shot if you need a quick spot around 3pm.</p>

<h2 id="dot--baltimore-it-should-provide-new-citation-description-options">DOT &amp; Baltimore IT Should Provide New Citation Description Options</h2>

<p>Of course as we’ve seen in the past, parking police are using the “All Other Parking Meter Violations” predominantly, which masks the true cause of the citation.  In this instance, these are metered parking spots so my guess is their time has expired.  This is something that DOT and Baltimore Mayor’s Office of IT could easily provide a new description code for so we know that this is the cause.  </p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Baltimore’s City Paper recently <a href="http://www.citypaper.com/news/mobtownbeat/bcp-victims-of-a-unique-baltimore-parking-problem-fight-the-law-and-the-law-wins-20141216,0,5288351.story">took a look at a unique parking situation</a> in Baltimore at the 4200 block of Wickford Road.  Unfortunately, they didn’t take a peek at the same open data for parking citations I’ve been investigating lately.</p>

<p>This road is a small two-way street in a quiet, wealthy neighborhood adjacent to the Johns Hopkins University campus called Keswick.  The street is narrow, and so vehicles typically park on either side with their tires past the curb which is illegal.  Apparently they also occasionally park on the left facing the wrong direction.  </p>

<p>Start here in Google Street View and work your way north - the street is indeed quite narrow and most cars (save for maybe the Smart car) are parked with their two right tires over the curb.  The Smart car and several others are parked on the left side facing the wrong direction.</p>

<center>
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1425404187666!6m8!1m7!1sgYu398RNv4HjfPUXZxCNiQ!2m2!1d39.339469!2d-76.627132!3f28.763235779444777!4f-26.84351693465949!5f0.7820865974627469" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0"></iframe>
</center>

<p>What is curious is that the <a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Transportation/Parking-Citations/n4ma-fj3m">open data for parking citations</a> at the 4200 block of Wickford Rd. are not showing a rampant citation issue as the article or residents suggest.</p>

<p>In fact, here is the full list of citations at the 4200 block of Wickford Rd. from the parking citation data.</p>

</figure>
</center>

<p>It truly pales in comparison to some of the <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Rapid-Increase-In-Citations/">blocks I’ve been looking at recently</a>.  The article claims that parking tickets have appeared in the middle of the night, “depicting the parking enforcement agents as thieves in the night.”  It looks like that actually was the case a couple few times - around 4:30am on April 4 and 10, 2014, and around 2:30am on April 18, 2014.  But overall, this article and the residents on this block appear to be making something out of nothing.  The grand total of fines issued for the 41 citations above is $1,312.</p>

    <p>Unless this dataset is somehow <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Quick-Response-From-Baltimore-Chief-Data-Officer/">still screwed up</a>, there was a stark shift in behavior that coincided with the explosion of parking citations issued in Baltimore.  </p>

<center>
<figure>
  <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/2015-02/Daily_Citations_Unpaid.png"><img src="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/2015-02/Daily_Citations_Unpaid.png" /></a>
</figure>
</center>

<p>The plot above shows the perentage of tickets (daily) that remain unpaid over time.  The trend in 2014 makes sense: practically 100% of the tickets issued yesterday would be unpaid.  One would expect that the further back in time one looks, less tickets would have an outstanding balance.  This is certainly the case looking back as far as January 2014, and I’ve added a dashed line to continue the expected trend further backwards in time.</p>

<p>But what actually happens looking back further than January 2014 is quite different.  According to these data, the proportion of unpaid tickets increases almost to almost 70% when looking back the full two years.  70% of tickets from 2 years ago unpaid, while 10% from a year ago unpaid?  This seems fishy.  I can imagine four possibilities as to why we see this in the data.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Dataset is still screwed up.</strong> Occam’s razor.  Q.E.D.  I asked Baltimore Chief Data Officer to check it out and will follow up soon.</li>
  <li><strong>Increase in penalties that incentivized prompt payment.</strong>  <a href="http://archive.baltimorecity.gov/portals/0/charter%20and%20Codes/code/Art%2031%20-%20Transit&amp;Traff.pdf"> Article 31 Subtitle 36 of the Baltimore City Code</a> establishes the fines for parking violations, and §36-22   in particular sets forth the penalties that accrue when deliquent.  Right now the penalties are set at the lesser of $16 per month delinquent or ten times the amount of the original fine.  It looks like the last time this section was modified was through Ordinance 10-302, but as far as I can tell this actually added the 10X cap on penalties so this can’t be it. </li>
  <li><strong>Parking ticket amnesty.</strong> <a href="http://archive.baltimorecity.gov/portals/0/charter%20and%20Codes/code/Art%2031%20-%20Transit&amp;Traff.pdf"> Article 31 Subtitle 36 of the Baltimore City Code</a> (§36-22 specifically) allows for the periodic offering of amnesty from penalties resulting from unpaid tickets.  The amnesty periods last 2 days.  This authority was established in 2003 at which time the first amnesty was offered.  The provisions also establish a ten-year moratorium on amnesties from the time of the first one, so the next one that could have been offered was 2013.  A parking ticket amnesty would certainly reduce the proportion of citations with an outstanding balance and could help explain the trend we see in 2013.  But another amnesty has not yet been offered as of February 2015, so this can’t explain the change in proportion of unpaid tickets we’re seeing.  Moreover, the trend we see in 2013 is across the entire year rather than a dramatic drop over a 2-day period that would result from such an amnesty period.</li>
  <li><strong>Change in sampling (behavior of those sampled).</strong>  Having eliminated options 2 and 3 and assuming the data are clean and reliable, the last option I came up with is that the rapid increase of parking citations in certain locations drastically biased the sample.  It would appear that the strategy of targeting specific locations as I’ve shown in <a href="">previous posts</a> has paid off, since the total fines issued has shot up while the proportion of tickets remaining unpaid has significantly dropped.  This is an indication of a much more effective parking policing policy (revenue generation) by the city, although it likely causes a lot of frustration for those living and parking in the targeted locations.</li>

<p>One can imagine that this explosion resulted from particular areas being targeted, rather than every block in Baltimore experiencing a proportional increase in citations issued.

<p>I’ve removed the “U/B” locations from the map below because it isn’t clear exactly which block those were issued on.  I tried reaching out to the Baltimore data people about it but haven’t had luck yet.  I believe they’re University of Baltimore locations, so suffice it to say that University of Baltimore has also become a target for parking enforcement.</p>

<p>The only one that appears somewhat random is the 5100 block of Roland Avenue.  Citations clearly exploded here…</p>

<p>“All other parking meter violations” really doesn’t help sort out what the cause is, but looking at the Google Map street view one can see a 2 hour parking sign.  The curb also looks like it’s non-existent, so I’m wondering if people put their tires into the grass and then get cited.</p>

<center>
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1424798998803!6m8!1m7!1soBC2bNc1uJIKNHPSkBn7ug!2m2!1d39.35523!2d-76.634564!3f223.74393718454644!4f-16.088865868843556!5f0.7820865974627469" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0"></iframe>
</center>

<h2 id="lot-jfa">“400 LOT JFA”</h2>

<p>I’ve also manually located the “400 LOT JFA” location on the map - I believe this is a parking lot under the Jones Falls Expressway, and the only one near a 400 block address is the one I’ve located.  Looking at the data, the police didn’t even start ticketing at this location until February 2014.  Again, “All other parking meter violations” is the dominant mode of citation, so I really don’t have a clue what might be going on.</p>

    <p>This is just a quick blurb to say I’m building a new page for my website for visualizing my electricity usage data.  You can find it in the upper left menu panel by clicking on “<a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/my-elec-use/">My Electricity Use</a>.”  Right now I’ve just got an interactive heat map up for the hourly data (based on this post).  I’m admittedly slow to the <a href="http://plot.ly">Plotly</a> game, but I’ll be using it a lot more regularly going forward.</p>
