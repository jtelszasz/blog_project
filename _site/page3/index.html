    <p>By varying parameters of the <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Intro-To-Storage-Model">demand-side storage model</a> we can determine the economic plausibility and benefits of home grid-tied batteries.  </p>

<p>While the actual logic and functions are in separate Python modules, I’m doing this analysis in an <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jtelszasz/demandside_storage/blob/master/analysis.ipynb">iPython notebook</a> that you can check out for more detail and thought process.</p>

<p>I set up some of summary metrics I was interested in in the <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Storage-Model-Details">last post</a> .  One that I didn’t have on that list that is an important economic indicator is the simple payback period, which is the number of years it would take to break even on the initial investment based on the yearly savings.</p>

<center>
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?PBP=\frac{Initial%20Investment}{Annual%20Variable%20Cost%20Savings}" alt="PBP=\frac{Initial%20Investment}{Annual%20Variable%20Cost%20Savings}" />
</center>

<p>The summary metrics I’ve calculated should indicate the benefits of having a home battery system to the consumer/household as well as the grid (system operator and grid).  Of course, these are going to be particular to the load profile I’m using (Green Button sample data), but another one-year hourly load profile could easily be supplanted to see how it would work out for other buildings.  </p>

<h2 id="summary-metrics-v-storage-capacity">Summary Metrics v. Storage Capacity</h2>

<p>One question that can be asked of the model is how certain summary metrics vary with the total battery capacity.  For example, an increase in battery size would allow the building to purchase more of the cheaper electricity during off-peak hours increasing the annual savings, but the initial investment also increases.  </p>

<p>All of the other parameters are held constant, with battery and inverter efficiencies during charging and discharging all set to 0.85 (the “inverter_efficiency” and “battery_efficiency” below are function handles).  The charge rate estimate is assuming it take 8 hours to fully charge the battery.  I’ve estimated the cost of deep-discharge lead acid batteries as being about $166 per kilowatt-hour of storage (based on a quick Amazon.com search that dug up $200 for a 1.2 kWh battery).  The model currently isn’t sophisticated enough to vary the charge and discharge rates based on voltage and current as should be done, but this should suffice for a rough estimate.  For an initial estimate, I also have not factored in battery replacement to the payback period, though this should have a substantial effect and I’ll need to do this at some point.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jtelszasz/demandside_storage/blob/master/analysis.ipynb">analysis notebook</a> I create an array with all of the battery sizes, and loop through them each time setting the bat_size variable to the next size in the array.  Each time, the model creates the output over the entire year (all 8,760 hours) and then calculates the summary metrics.  The result is a dataframe of all the summary metrics indexed by summary size.</p>

</center>

<p>Now it’s easy to create some plots to illustrate how these metrics change with storage capacity.</p>

<h3 id="cost-savings-and-payback-period">Cost Savings and Payback Period</h3>

<p>The expectation is that there are diminishing returns, since there is a limited number of peak hours energy demand that can be supplied by electricity purchased during off-peak hours, while of course the amount of battery storage we can purchase is unlimited.  Based on this plot, the most storage we should purchase is 15 kWh worth.  The percent savings calculated is with respect to the default static BGE residential electricity prices, in other words what this home would have paid over the course of the year in electricity supplied (not including fixed tariffs and charges).</p>

  <figcaption>Annual cost savings for demand-side storage (home battery) system.</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

<p>In general, the payback periods are a bit longer than I thought they would be.  There’s a clear optimum solution at a storage capacity of 5 kWh with the payback period being about 14.5 years.  What’s really driving the cost effectiveness (I think) is the difference between the peak and off-peak cost of electricity.  A wider difference between these prices will make it more cost effective to purchase storage and electricity during off-peak hours.</p>

<h3 id="grid-benefits-load-shaving">Grid Benefits (Load Shaving)</h3>

<p>This pretty closely mirrors the cost savings, and understandably so since the costs are directly proportional to the amount of electricity being removed from peak-hours and purchased instead during off-peak hours.  At 15 kWh of storage we’ve just about maxed out the amount of peak time kilowatt-hours we can shave, which is all off the electricity demand for this house occuring during peak hours.  This is about 1800 kWh for this house’s load profile.</p>

</figure>
</center>

<h3 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h3>

<p>Since electricity purchased simultanesously with demand (not shifted using storage) doesn’t go through any other equipment, the system’s efficiency is effectively 100% since all the electricity purchased goes directly to the serve the demand.  However, electricity purchased during off-peak hours for use at a later time first goes through the inverter to become DC, then is stored in the battery (also lossy), and takes the opposite process on the way out.  That means that the quantity of kilowatt-hours purchased from the grid becomes higher as more electricity is bought and stored.  For this reason, the “efficiency” (the total annual kWh demand divided by the total kWh purchased from the grid) drops as storage size increases. </p>

  <figcaption>Total kWh purchased during year for demand-side storage (home battery) system.</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

<p>This is an important (albeit predictable) result since it means we’ve effectively increased the carbon footprint of the home, assuming the electricity mix is dominated by carbon-intensive power sources.  What such a system could allow for, however, is that intermittent renewable resources could more readily integrate with storage acting as a buffer between demand and intermittent supply.</p>

<p>This makes changes in hourly trends over the course of the year readily apparent, and even highlights differences day to day.  The 6am/7am peak is pretty clear, as are the evening hours in the summer.  Between midnight a 4am, the usage is clearly higher (deeper yellow) in the summer as well due to AC load.</p>

    <p>This post fills in some more details of the <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Intro-To-Storage-Model">demand-side storage model</a>.</p>

<p>In the last post I presented a flow chart of how the logic works but didn’t give a diagram of what the physical system might look like.  That’s below.</p>

<p>I’ve illustrated the switch as being a separate component so we can see that electricity could bypass actually being inverted and stored (electricity from the grid sometimes goes directly to the demand).  In reality, the inverter/switch/charge controller would be one system.  This unit and the batteries would be the initial costs for the system.</p>

<h2 id="model-parameters">Model Parameters</h2>

<p>For electricity going straight to serve demand (not being stored first), there are essentially no additonal losses.  However, batteries only accept DC electricity, so we need an inverter to turn the AC off the grid to DC and back.  There are losses associated with this conversion, and the batteries themselves are lossy.  For now I’ve set these efficiencies as constants, but implemented them in functions so they could in the future get more sophisticated modeling (charging efficiency for batteries is dependent on depth of charge).  The nominal efficiency values are taken from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Renewable-Efficient-Electric-Power-Systems/dp/0471280607/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412769771&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=renewable+and+efficient+electric+power+systems">Renewable and Efficient Electric Power Systems by Gilbert Masters</a>.</p>

<p>There are also several other system parameters that need to be initialized, including the size of the storage, costs, etc.  In future analyses these variables can be varied to assess the effects on costs and energy.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>Once the model has calculated all the energy flows for each hour over the course of the year, I calculate a set of key properties of the system behavior.  These results are shown in the table below.  These are the characteristics I’ll be interested in as the system parameters described above are varied (though I may modify this set).</p>

<ul>
  <li>’% Peak Demand Battery’: Percent of the total peak demand over the year served from the battery</li>
  <li>’% Peak kWh Shaved’: Percent of the total demand during peak hours removed from the grid</li>
  <li>’% Purchased During Off-Peak’: Percent of annual electricity purchased during off-peak hours</li>
  <li>’% Purchased During Peak’: Percent of annual electricity purchased during peak hours</li>
  <li>‘Annual System Eff’: Total annual demand divided by total annual electricity purchased</li>
  <li>‘Annual Var Cost’: Annual electricity cost</li>
  <li>‘Hours Battery Depleted’: Number of hours in the year that battery is drained to maximum depth of discharge</li>
  <li>‘Hours Battery Full’: Number of hours in the year that battery is fully charged</li>
  <li>‘Hours on Battery Only’: Number of hours in the year that demand is served by battery alone</li>
  <li>‘Initial Cost’: Initial system cost (inverter + batteries)</li>
  <li>‘Peak kWh Shaved’: Total electricity during peak hours removed from the grid</li>
  <li>‘Total kWh Purchased’: Total annual electricity purchased</li>
</ul>

<p>For these initial values, what stood out to me was that I removed 54% of the residence’s annual peak demand from the grid (this is the ‘% Peak kWh Shaved’).  This is the reason utilities might want to think about incentivizing residential customers to purchase grid-tied battery systems such as this (beyond just the time-of-use-pricing incentive itself).  I should say that the current model is agnostic to exactly which peak hours load is being shaved from - it just uses the battery first until it’s depleted and then switches to grid during peak hours.  Utilities would want to be a bit more sensitive to this, since their peak time-of-use currently starts at 10am weekdays in the summer but the actual “peak” won’t hit until around 4pm.  In the current model I’ve created, the battery is used up first so I wouldn’t be shaving peak load at 4pm.  This could be addressed with some logic that is a bit more clever than what I’ve currently got.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Buying lead-acid batteries and switching to one of <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/BGE-Pricing">BGE’s time-of-use pricing plans</a> may be a very good idea indeed.</p>

<p>BGE (and many other utilities in the U.S.) are now offering a time-of-use pricing plan in which the price you pay for electricity depends on what time of day or season you are purchasing it.  This is one of the so-called “demand-side strategies” that could help utilities reduce peak loads and prevent blackouts.  In a <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Should-I-Switch-To-TOU-Pricing">previous post</a>, I looked at whether it would make financial sense for me to switch over to one of these plans.</p>

<p>One can imagine taking further advantage of these plans by purchasing most or all electricity during off-peak (cheap) hours without having to buy much or any during peak hours.  In order to explore how this might work and how beneficial it would be, I built a model in Python that simulates the hourly energy flows for a home with lead-acid battery storage.</p>

<p>There are two sources of data that drive the model.  First, I’ve used one of the <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Feeding-The-Data-Monster">Green Button sample data files</a>, specifically the one for an inland, single-family residence.  This is an hourly electricity demand profile for the whole residential building for all of 2011.  Second, I’ve again used <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/BGE-Pricing">BGE’s time-of-use pricing schemes</a> to determine peak hours and costs.  Some of the ideas are based on <a href="http://sel.columbia.edu/matlab-assignment-1">a Matlab assignment I worked on in grad school</a>.  While I no longer have access to the top tier journals (Elsevier is a capitalist racket), I did find a couple papers <a href="https://www.thlab.net/wp-content/uploads/publications/pub_19.pdf">here</a> and <a href="http://www.ecs.umass.edu/~irwin/smartcharge.pdf">here</a> that are using similar algorithms.</p>

<p>I’ve drawn out a flow chart to show how the model works.  During off-peak times, the demand is served directly from the grid and if the battery isn’t full, extra energy is purchased to charge the battery (there is a maximum rate at which this can occur).  During peak times, energy is first used out of the battery to serve the demand.  Only when the battery is drained (to an acceptable charge level, say 30%) is energy then purchased from the grid to serve demand directly.  No energy is purchased to charge the battery during peak hours.</p>

<p>In the plot below, I’ve shown the behavior of the system for a typical summer day.  Peak hours are shaded.  As you can see, during off-peak hours additional energy is purchased in order to recharge the battery.  During peak hours, the battery is discharged preferentially before purchasing any peak-hour electricity in order to minimize cost.</p>

  <figcaption>Model behavior for summer weekday, with peak period shaded in gray.</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

<p>In the above plot there are two energy flows from the grid - one going to serve demand directly and the other to storage.  (There are actually three shown since I separate peak from off-peak, but you get the idea.)  To make a bit clearer how much energy is being purchased at each hour, I’ve summed those two quanities and plotted below.  Clearly in the off-peak hours, a bit extra is being purchased to charge the batteries.  During the first part of the peak period, nothing has to be purchased from the grid since the battery is serving the demand.  Once that is depleted, energy has to be purchased during the remainder of the peak period.</p>

  <figcaption>Amount of energy purchased in storage model, with peak period shaded in gray.</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

<p>It’s important to remember that the actual quantity of killowatt-hours of electricity purchased over the course of the year isn’t different than without storage, it’s just being purchased from the grid at different hours.  The consumer doesn’t need to modify their gluttonous behavior in order to make this work.  The benefit to the consumer is saving money, and the benefit to the utility is shaving peak loads.  </p>

<p>A bunch of questions are already popping up in my head:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the payback period for the battery system?</li>
  <li>How do the size of the battery and the peak-off-peak cost differential affect the payback period?</li>
  <li>What percent of hours/energy over the course of the year come through the storage system as opposed to directly from grid?</li>
  <li>How much storage is needed so that peak hour electricity is never purchased and how much does this cost?  What is the payback period?</li>
  <li>How does the cost of the system change with percent of peak-hour demand served by storage?</li>
</ul>

    <p>It’s been a bit.  Work got busy, I got stalled and needed an IDE, and I developed a new model.</p>

<p>I didn’t have much time over the summer for this stuff.  My real job got pretty busy.  You don’t care about that though.</p>

<p>I did get a bit stalled.  As I’ve discussed previously, I’ve used iPython notebooks <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/the-work">quite a bit</a> for conducting analyses.  These only got me so far.  I’ve been working on a demand-side storage model to figure out how to take advantage of time-of-use pricing now available from utility companies.  While the notebooks work great for documenting analyses and creating plots, building a model is nearly impossible with them.  They aren’t really useful if you need multiple functions and scripts.  I was encountering bugs early on in building the model and couldn’t fix them.  It was frustrating.</p>

<p>This type of scientific computing really calls for an integrated development environment, or IDE.  It’s the one thing I’ve been missing since starting in with Python in lieu of Matlab.  An IDE gives you an interactive console, debugging capabilities, and an editor all in one program.  After reading a bit online, it seemed the two big ones for Python were <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> and <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm">Pycharm</a>.  I started with Eclipse.  I couldn’t for the life of me get it working, something about the external libraries I was using wasn’t getting set up right.  I tried every way imaginable, but this was as frustrating as the original bugs in my code.  I switched to Pycharm, and pretty quickly was up and running.</p>

<p>Long story short, with an IDE in hand I found my bugs pretty quickly and finished building the model over a weekend.  I definitely recommend Pycharm or another IDE (even trying Eclipse, if you can get it working) for anything more complicated than simple models or exploratory data analysis.  You could even write all your functions and scripts for a model in an IDE and then switch to notebooks for analysis and results of the model.</p>

    <p>Now that I’ve got BGE’s available <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/BGE-Pricing">residential time-of-use plans</a>, I can evaluate whether I would save money by switching to one.</p>

<p>At each hour, I multiply the cost of electricty by the electricity usage for that hour.  To give an apples-to-apples comparison, I’m using the current 2014-2015 rates and assuming there weren’t any rate changes.  Also, I’m only looking at the actual cost of the commodity, not all the fees and rates (“riders”) that get tacked on.  Those additional costs add up to about 40% of your electricity bill, but since they’re not affected by the rate being charged for the electricity they’d be the same for each plan.  (In fact there was a change at on June 1, 2014, and there always will be changes.)  Again, the plans are “R” (basic), “RL” (time-of-use), and “EV” (aggressive time-of-use for electric vehicle owners).  The plot below shows the savings for the “RL” and “EV” plans as compared to what I would have paid with the “R” plan.</p>

<center>

  <figcaption>Cost savings in U.S. dollars on monthly electricity bill compared to BGE residential "R" plan.</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

<p>As a sanity check, the actual electricity cost for July on the “R” plan matches pretty closely what’s actually on our bill for July.  The bill is for 670 kWh at $0.08857/kWh for a total electricity supply cost of $59.34.  My hourly data shows 671.6 kWh usage for July (not sure why there is a difference here from the bill) and with the regular “R” plan at $.08975/kWh the supply cost would have been $57.87.  (As a sidenote, I’m unclear as to what what the difference is between the $.08857/kWh cost that is billed and the $.08975/kWh cost that is listed as the summer kWh prices as of June 1, 2014. <a href="http://www.bge.com/myaccount/billsrates/ratestariffs/electricservice/Electric%20Rates%20Information%20Documents/POLR_Rates_PTC_MiscCharges.pdf">This</a> lists both of those figures, but footnote 1 in the table in the upper right table doesn’t really explain the adjustment that well.)</p>

<p>In terms of savings with dynamic pricing plans, we’d pretty clearly benefit during the summer months.  At the new place during the week, we shut pretty much everything off during the day and only use air conditioning at night.  Moreover, our water heating is electric which leads to much higher peak electricity demands during early mornings and late evenings (particularly in the mornings when we shower).  We’d therefore be taking advantage of the cheaper electricity prices during off-peak hours.  At the old place our heat is part (large part) of the electricity load and during the winter and spring months, our thermostat was operational most hours of most days, and so there are less opportunities for savings since our load isn’t skewed towards off-peak hours.  Shown below again is our typical usage at the old (March 2014) and new (June 2014) apartments (original post is <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Mo-Apartment-Mo-Energy">here</a>).  </p>

  <figcaption>Cost savings in U.S. dollars on monthly electricity bill compared to BGE residential "R" plan.</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

<p>The total annual savings for the sample set would be $27.23 for the “RL” plan compared to the regular “R” plan, and $60.25 for the “EV” plan.  These aren’t large chunks, but I think that’s probably by design.  BGE doesn’t want to lose an excessive amount of revenue by having people switch over to dynamic pricing plans.  At the same time, providing some incentive to switch, especially for electric vehicle owners (mind you this would be a different analysis), makes for a more reliable grid during the peak hours of the summer months by shaving or shifting load.</p>

    <p>A quick blurb on a couple of pieces of the demand-side storage puzzle I’m working on.</p>

<p>First, turns out I’m going to use the Green Button sample data that I <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/feeding-the-data-monster">previously found</a>.  They have <a href="http://services.greenbuttondata.org/sample-data.html">several of these datasets posted</a> that may be interesting for comparison later.  It took an embarassing amount of time to sort out my first time parsing an XML file.  Word of advice for you data/Python peoples: don’t use ElementTree, I used BeautifulSoup and it was much simpler.</p>

  <figcaption>Green Button sample hourly data for inland single family residence, resampled to daily.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Definitely nice to have a full year worth of clean data.  You can also clearly see the bump up in summer usage from A/C loads.</p>

<p>In sorting out the demand-side storage question, I also took a look at what pricing schemes BGE has on offer.  They currently have the normal <a href="http://www.bge.com/myaccount/billsrates/ratestariffs/electricservice/Electric%20Services%20Rates%20and%20Tariffs/P3_SCH_R.pdf">residential plan (“R”)</a>, a <a href="http://www.bge.com/myaccount/billsrates/ratestariffs/electricservice/Electric%20Services%20Rates%20and%20Tariffs/P3_SCH_RL.pdf">residential time-of-use, or TOU, plan (“RL”)</a>, and a <a href="http://www.bge.com/myaccount/billsrates/ratestariffs/electricservice/Electric%20Services%20Rates%20and%20Tariffs/ScheduleEV.pdf">plan for electric vehicle customers (“EV”)</a>.  All of the actual costs for peak, off-peak, and intermediate are found <a href="http://www.bge.com/myaccount/billsrates/ratestariffs/electricservice/Electric%20Services%20Rates%20and%20Tariffs/Rdr_1.pdf">here</a>.  Obviously, there are a proverbial shit-ton of other nickel-and-dime tariffs, but since they’re paid per kilowatt-hour and aren’t tied to the actual price of electricity itself.  I’m assuming for the sake of comparison that the total number of kilowatt-hours you use is independent of the pricing plan you have. </p>

<p>Here’s what the three pricing plans look like for weekdays in summer and non-summer periods.</p>

    <p>Here’s a quick comparison of average weekdays and weekends in the new and old apartments.</p>

<p>It would appear that we’ve been using more at the new place, but take a look at the daily totals. </p>

<figure>
  <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/2014-08/Average_Days_New_and_Old_Apts.png"><img src="http://www.thetrainingset.com/images/2014-08/Average_Days_New_and_Old_Apts.png" /></a>
  <figcaption>Average hourly electric usage for new and old apartments, March and June.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Of course we don’t have apples-to-apples comparisons here.  Of course this is partly due to weather.  The old apartment is shown for March, where we left the thermostat on all day at 65 degrees F so Willow The Cat wouldn’t freeze to death.  At the new apartment, we’re shutting off the thermostat entirely during the day, and at night kicking it on to 75 degrees F.  So for weekdays, we’re consuming much less during the day but evenings are much higher.  </p>

<p>However, the <a href="http://www.thetrainingset.com/articles/Guess-What-Time-Justin-Wakes-Up">6am peak when we wake up</a> is also much higher.  I’m sure that this is due to our own dedicated electric water heater at the new place.  Our two showers in the morning plus lighting loads are the 6am peak, while the evening hours are the A/C and any dishwashing we’re doing after dinner.</p>

<p>To do these average day plots I set up a quick function that uses groupby, that way I can reuse this for any time period.</p>

    <p>Steph and I moved on May 23.  </p>

<p>I didn’t manage to grab the data for the last three weeks of May before changing apartments (and therefore BGE accounts), so I missed out on those three weeks of data.  However, we’ve now been there just over two months and so we’ve got some A/C load data to work with.</p>

<p>The differences in the data are pretty staggering.  One issue is that we moved at the beginning of summer so our previous apartment with electric resistance heating has all the heating loads and the new apartment with central A/C has all the cooling loads.  The rest of the differences are described below.</p>

<h3 id="physical-differences-in-apartments">Physical Differences in Apartments</h3>

<p>Our old and new apartments are less than half a mile apart on the same street that runs north and south (St. Paul Street in Baltimore).  There are some important differences of note between the two apartments.</p>

<p><strong>Size</strong>. The new apartment is much larger in floor area, and has ceilings that appear even higher (though I didn’t take measurements at the old apartment).  In addition to large living room and bedroom, the new apartment has two bathrooms, a much larger kitchen and attached dining space, and a large foyer.</p>

<p><strong>Building Envelope and Fenestration</strong>. The building itself is still row style, so our exterior exposure is limited to the front of the building and the back.  The old apartment only had exposure in the rear to a fire escape corridor down the center of the building, not to the very rear of the building.  Our new apartment has practically floor to ceiling windows in the front and back.  The new apartment windows are less than 10 years old, where the windows from the last apartment were original single pane and were considerably drafty.</p>

<p><strong>Space Heating</strong>.  Space heating at the old apartment was provided by electric resistance heating in two zones (living room and bedroom) from ductless split A/C units (the A/C compressor failed on the living room zone).  This means that the electricity data I’ve been using for the old apartment include heating loads.  The new apartment has an <a href="http://www.commercial.carrier.com/commercial/hvac/product_technical_literature/1,3069,CLI1_DIV41_ETI4922_PRD694,00.html">80,000 Btu/h input natural gas-fired central furnace</a>.  We’re lucky enough that it’s a condensing furnace (efficient enough that flue gases cool below their condensing point) with an AFUE of 92.1%. The new data will not include heating loads since this is gas-fired, and the only information we’d have on gas use would be monthly.  We moved in at the end of May so there haven’t been any heating loads yet.  </p>

<p><strong>Space Cooling</strong>.  The compressor for the ductless split A/C in the living room failed, and they were cheapskates and replaced it with a window unit.  An 11,000 Btu/h output unit for a family room and kitchen with high ceilings and drafty single pane windows.  In the new apartment, we have central A/C. (<a href="http://www.commercial.carrier.com/wcs/proddesc_display/0,2733,CLI1_DIV41_ETI4926_NBD_PRD1311,00.html">This</a> is the evaporator coil, I haven’t looked closely at the compressor outside yet.)  In both cases, we shut the A/C off during the day, and generally set the thermostat to 75 degrees Fahrenheit when we’re home in evenings and on weekends.</p>

<p><strong>Water Heating</strong>. In our previous apartment, hot water was included.  In the new apartment, we have a dedicated <a href="http://products.geappliances.com/ApplProducts/Dispatcher?REQUEST=SpecPage&amp;Sku=GE38S06AAG">38-gallon electric water heater</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Lighting</strong>. There are many more light fixtures in the new apartment, though the vast majority use compact florescents. The former living room had only the light (incandescents) from a ceiling fan, while the new living room has 6 recessed lights and a ceiling fan light.  Additionally, there’s a ceiling fan with chandelier in the foyer, 5 recessed ceiling lights in the kitchen and dining room, along with halogen lighting underneath the cabintery in the kitchen.</p>

<p><strong>Appliances</strong>.  The previous aparment had only the basics - a refrigerator, microwave (ours, and small), and gas oven range. Our new apartment additionally has a dishwasher and in-aparment laundry washer and dryer.</p>

<p><strong>Usage</strong>.  Generally, our schedules haven’t really changed.  Like I mentioned previously, we shut the A/C off during the day, and only really use it in the evenings (after 7pm or so) and on weekends and only set it to 75 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

    <p>Scouring the interwebz for some data.</p>

<p>There are a few research questions that I’d like to dig into but I haven’t quite found the right data yet for them.  Ideally I would use our apartment data, but I need at least some summer data (early June won’t count) and we actually just moved apartments.  There are some important differences between the previous and current apartment - namely central AC, larger but less leaky windows, a much larger floor plan, a dishwasher, and a dedicated apartment electric water heater.  </p>

<p>I’ve done some digging to come up with some other candidate datasets, though this is by no means comprehensive.  I’m mainly looking for at least a year worth of hourly electricity data (or finer scale that could be resampled) for a household or apartment with moderate or high summer air conditioning loads. A lot of the publicly available electricity usage datasets I’ve found have been geared toward non-invasive appliance load monitoring (NIALM) research - test data for algorithms that can breakout appliance end uses based on the electricity signatures.  Generally these are very high frequency (sub-minute time scales) but cover much shorter spans than needed (really a full year).  Hopefully this compilation is useful for other researchers out there.</p>

<p>I think I might also put some of these in an appropriate Github folder and turn this post into a readme for future use.  There are plenty more out there that are geared towards the NIALM stuff so if I get into that more, I can add it to the list there.</p>

<h3 id="green-button-sample-datasets">Green Button Sample Datasets</h3>

<p>Since BGE has signed on to use the Green Button data standard (like most utilities using smart meters have) I’m hoping to use a sample dataset, since it would easily be replaced by my own data once it’s available.</p>

<p>The National Institute for Standards and Technology has a <a href="https://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-sggrid/bin/view/SmartGrid/GreenButtonSDK">list of available sample datasets on their website</a> for the software development kit, or SDK.  It isn’t specified what type of building or location the samples are from, but they do provide hourly profiles that add up to a full year’s worth of data.  This may be worth digging into.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-sggrid/bin/view/SmartGrid/GreenButtonSDK">same NIST website</a> links to some data from San Diego Gas and Electric (SDGE).  There are multiple hourly datasets listed, and they specify a region within SDGE’s territory that the data have come from (coastal, inland, desert, etc.)</p>

<p>I also found <a href="http://www.sdge.com/documents/green-button-60-min-meter-interval-sample-data-csv">this</a> sample on SDGE’s own website.  It’s one year worth of hourly interval electrcity usage data for a residence.  At least looking at this one dataset qualitatively, the A/C loads don’t peak nearly as badly as I’d expect in Baltimore during the summer so I probably won’t use this.</p>

<h3 id="pecan-street-research-institute">Pecan Street Research Institute</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.pecanstreet.org">Pecan Street Research Institute</a> curates possibly the largest residential energy and water consumption dataset.  The effort was initiated in 2009 and monitors the electricity, gas, and water use of over 900 homes in Texas at 1-minute resolution.  The electricity monitoring includes both whole house and up to 23 submetered circuits.  Unfortunately you have to be an active academic researcher to even obtain a free sample of the dataset, let alone full access to the whole shebang.</p>

<h3 id="jack-kelly-phd-student-at-imperial-college">Jack Kelly, PhD student at Imperial College</h3>

<p>Jack Kelly at Imperial College has been gracious enough to post his home monitoring datasets on <a href="https://www.github.com/jackkelly">Github</a>.  He’s been monitoring two homes for electricity usage and sub-minute timescales, neither of which include air-conditioning data.  The lack of air conditioning doesn’t really help me.</p>

<h3 id="kaggle-competition-sample-data">Kaggle Competition Sample Data</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.kaggle.com">Kaggle</a> hosts a platform for open competitions that usually ask competitors to devise machine learning or statistical predicitions, the most accurate prediction winning.  Several of the competitions have involved energy - either forecasting demand or disaggregating demand data into end uses (Kaggle’s actual business involves the application of machine learning for the energy industry).  The <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/belkin-energy-disaggregation-competition">disaggregation competition, sponsored by Belkin</a>, asked competitors to try and make use of a particular technique in order to tease out how much energy was used for various appliances.  The data used for this is very high frequency resolution for four houses.</p>

<h3 id="uci-center-for-machine-learning-and-intelligent-systems">UCI Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems</h3>

<p>University of California at Irvine has a center in the computer science department that has sourced a <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption">dataset from researchers in Clamart, France</a>.  It appears the minute-resolution, sub-metered data (more than 2 million rows) were recorded by Georges Hebrail et al. for a home in France, but I haven’t been able to find traceback information to confirm.  Unfortunately, while one of the three submeters supposedly captures a water heater and an air conditioner, it’s clear that household member behavior - particularly when it comes to air conditioning - is substantially different than ours.  (This is likely the result of higher energy prices driving reduced consumption, something Americans are only familiar with when gasoline prices jump.)  Since I know our electricity consumption will spike significantly higher this summer, I don’t think this will be a useful dataset.</p>
