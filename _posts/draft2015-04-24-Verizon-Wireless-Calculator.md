Last weekend, my 2-year contract came due for a phone upgrade.  Seeing as how I'm on an iPhone 4 and Apple's recent OS upgrades have sucked the life clean out of it, I was looking forward to purchasing a new phone with the hopes that the new one will last beyond the 2-year cycle.  I was going to purchase an iPhone 6, and I knew (or so I thought) what it would cost up front if I were to sign on a new 2-year contract.  Simple, straight-forward.  No sales pitches necessary.  A basic exchange of currency and goods that predates democracy and free markets.

Then I entered the Verizon Wireless store.

Within a few moments of arrival and signing in my name was called and I was paired with a sales rep.  Hovering over me, he quickly moved the conversation from the phone itself to something called the Edge plan.  I hadn't bothered looking at the Edge plan before coming to the store - from the marketing material it seemed that it was targeted at customers interested in upgrading their phone more rapidly than every two years.  I do not count myself in that category, so I didn't bother looking into it.
