The city <a href='http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-ci-freddie-gray-officers-20150421-story.html'>released the names of the six officers involved in Freddie Gray's arrest and subsequent death</a>.

 Below is how much each of them earned in fiscal year 2014 based on <a href='http://data.baltimorecity.gov'>Open Baltimore</a> data.

The six officers have been suspended **with pay**.  Assuming a 40 hour work week and 48 working weeks in the year, below are these officers' hourly wages, daily wages, and assuming a 50% ratio of salary for benefits and insurance (typical assumption for wage calculations), the six officers are costing Baltimore City taxpayers $2,151.44 every day of their suspension.  Today is April 26 and as far as I can tell from <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/21/freddie-gray-death-baltimore-officers-suspended_n_7105368.html'>the earliest Associated Press announcement</a> of their suspension, the officers have been suspended for six days, so the **current bill to taxpayers is $12,908.63 and counting**.
