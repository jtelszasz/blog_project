I live in Baltimore and commute to DC for work everyday, and am often asked how long the commute is. Although the total round trip is technically three hours, I prefer to think of it as one hour of actual commute (walking, DC Metro) with two hours to do as I please on the MARC commuter train.  Although reading, podcasts and other media are entertaining filler, after a short time I decided rather to spend my time productively.  This blog is the product of my efforts during my commute to learn more about data analysis techniques.

## Me

My name is Justin, and by training I'm a mechanical engineer.  I help write energy efficiency policy for the U.S. Department of Energy but am also interested in data analytics and urban planning.  I'm one of the many fabled PhD dropouts, and so I use this blog as a means for exploring and researching topics I find interesting.  If you have ideas, data, questions, or problems hit me up!
