Last weekend, my 2-year contract came due for a phone upgrade.  Seeing as how I'm on an iPhone 4 and Apple's recent OS upgrades have sucked the life clean out of it, I was looking forward to purchasing a new phone with the hopes that the new one will last beyond the 2-year cycle.  I was going to purchase an iPhone 6, and I knew (or so I thought) what it would cost up front if I were to sign on a new 2-year contract.  Simple, straight-forward.  No sales pitches necessary.  A basic exchange of currency and goods that predates democracy and free markets.

Then I entered the Verizon Wireless store.

I started by looking at phone options just for kicks, but within a few moments my name was called and I was paired with a sales rep.  Hovering over me, he quickly moved the conversation from the phone itself to something called the Edge plan.  


Politicians seemingly pick numbers, figures, statistics, and trends out of thin air.  This can be infuriating no matter where you fall on the political spectrum.  Why don't we push politicians to post annotated transcripts of their speeches and debates that provide citations?  Surely they have an intern or two that they can promote from sticking signs on front lawns to transcribing and footnoting.  This would be a big step in the direction of transparency and a substantive way to keep politicians honest.

**I'd propose we call it the <a href='https://twitter.com/search?q=%23showyourwork&src=typd'>#ShowYourWork</a> campaign.**  If elementary school kids can show their work on math problems and high schoolers can cite their references in English papers, surely our politicians can follow their lead.  Moreover, it would signal a commitment to and appreciation for the STEM fields that politicians like to pay lip service to when it comes to job growth.
