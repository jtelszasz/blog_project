Opower posted <a href='http://blog.opower.com/2014/09/ami-data-integration/'>a heat map of hourly electricity demand</a> that I wanted to replicate for our data.

This makes changes in hourly trends over the course of the year readily apparent, and even highlights differences day to day.  The 6am/7am peak is pretty clear, as are the evening hours in the summer.  Between midnight a 4am, the usage is clearly higher (deeper yellow) in the summer as well due to AC load.
