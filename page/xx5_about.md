Thanks for visiting. Hopefully these definitions fill you in on why I've named my site "The Training Set."

My name is Justin, and by education and background I'm a mechanical engineer.  I help write energy efficiency policy for the U.S. Department of Energy but I'm also interested in data science and bringing science to bear on social and environmental issues.  More than anything though, I'm out to solve problems.  I use this blog as a means for exploring and researching topics I find interesting.  If you have ideas, data, questions, or problems hit me up!
