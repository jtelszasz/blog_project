In an  <a href="{{ site.url }}/articles/My-BGE-Smart-Meter-Data">earlier post</a>, I showed initial descriptive plots for my electricity use.  Now that we have some more data, we can break these up to see differences as the spring season progresses.

Another way of showing the difference in each month's energy consumption patterns would be the cumulative distribution.

The plot above shows that for a given hourly kilowatt-hour amount, the proportion of hours at which the consumption was that amount or less is substantially higher in March than in April; of course, we'd expect that with the warmer weather.  For example, about 18% of the time in February the hourly consumption was 1 kilowatt-hour or less, while in March it was the case about 70% of the time.
