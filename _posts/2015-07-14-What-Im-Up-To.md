Just a quick note to highlight some recent publicity.

In June, Technical.ly was kind enough to again shine a light on some of my analysis, this time <a href='http://technical.ly/baltimore/2015/06/04/baltimore-blight-maps-ouazad-elszasz/'>on vacant buildings and lots in Baltimore</a>.  <a href='http://plot.ly'>Plot.ly</a> also <a href='https://plot.ly/ipython-notebooks/baltimore-vital-signs/'>used my iPython notebook</a> for my <a href='http://bniajfi.org/'>Baltimore Vital Signs</a> analysis as an example of how to use the tool.

This past Friday I participated in <a href='http://bniajfi.org/data_day/2015agenda/'>Baltimore Data Day</a> hosted by <a href='http://bniajfi.org/'>Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance</a> at University of Baltimore.  I was invited to contribute to a panel on civic technology and I sincerely hope someone, anyone, in the room gained something from it.  <a href='http://technical.ly/baltimore/2015/07/13/data-day-crime-data-bmoremapped-training-set/'>Technical.ly</a> has a quick blurb about it as well as my quick glance at Baltimore police arrest data post-Freddie Gray.  Also be sure to check out Ryan Smith's map work <a href='http://www.bmoremapped.com/'>here</a> and stay tuned for his new crime map.

**Coming up July 28**, I'll be at the <a href='http://www.meetup.com/Transportation-Techies/events/222183536/'>DC Transportation Techies meetup</a> which is making a cameo in Baltimore at the Hyatt Regency.

I've added all this stuff to <a href='{{ site.url }}/The-Work'>The Work</a> page (upper left corner) as well as my slide deck from my <a href='http://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Civic-Hacking-Meetup/events/222166589/'>"Apps Are Not The Answer"</a> talk at <a href='http://www.hackbaltimore.org'>Hack Baltimore</a>.
