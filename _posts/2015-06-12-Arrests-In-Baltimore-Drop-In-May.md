There's been quite a bit of discussion about whether or not protests regarding police brutality have made it less likely that police are willing to do the hard work necessary to enforce the law and fight crime.  <!--more-->

No matter which camp you're in, it's clear (at least as far as the published data are concerned) that <a href='http://http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/13/us/after-freddie-gray-death-west-baltimores-police-presence-drops-and-murders-soar.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0'>arrests have taken a dive in Baltimore</a>.  Police Commissioner Batts can dodge or deflect all he wants, but as has been reported, arrests have dropped and the city data corroborate it.  Total arrests in the <a href='http://data.baltimorecity.gov'>Open Baltimore</a> data for April 2015 were 2,438 while in May there were 1,449, a drop of about 40%.

Having the granular arrest data for Baltimore we can also take a look at whether or not the decline in arrests was more pronounced in particular areas (like West Baltimore, as the NY Times article linked above describes).  At first glance a lot (around 45%) of arrest records are not geocoded with a lat-long pair and without knowing the reason for this exclusion it's a safer assumption that there is some bias in the data available.  Stay tuned.
