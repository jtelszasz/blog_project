    <p>The total number of parking citations in Baltimore exploded between September 2013 and March 2014.  </p>

<p>One can imagine that this explosion resulted from particular areas being targeted, rather than every block in Baltimore experiencing a proportional increase in citations issued.  Below are the top 25 blocks in terms of the difference between parking citations issued in the month of September 2013 and March 2014.</p>

<p>I’ve removed the “U/B” locations from the map below because it isn’t clear exactly which block those were issued on.  I tried reaching out to the Baltimore data people about it but haven’t had luck yet.  I believe they’re University of Baltimore locations, so suffice it to say that University of Baltimore has also become a target for parking enforcement.</p>

<p>The locations are wholly predictable.  The stretch of North Charles Street through Mt. Vernon, Light Street in Federal Hill, Harbor East, Fells Point, and some spots near hospitals.  </p>

<h2 id="roland-ave">5100 Roland Ave.</h2>

<p>The only one that appears somewhat random is the 5100 block of Roland Avenue.  Citations clearly exploded here…</p>

<p>“All other parking meter violations” really doesn’t help sort out what the cause is, but looking at the Google Map street view one can see a 2 hour parking sign.  The curb also looks like it’s non-existent, so I’m wondering if people put their tires into the grass and then get cited.</p>

<h2 id="lot-jfa">“400 LOT JFA”</h2>

<p>I’ve also manually located the “400 LOT JFA” location on the map - I believe this is a parking lot under the Jones Falls Expressway, and the only one near a 400 block address is the one I’ve located.  Looking at the data, the police didn’t even start ticketing at this location until February 2014.  Again, “All other parking meter violations” is the dominant mode of citation, so I really don’t have a clue what might be going on.</p>

<p>Since the <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/sun-investigates/bs-md-speed-camera-hearing-20141201-story.html">traffic camera program ended in Baltimore in 2013</a> it appears enforcement policies have taken a dramatic turn to make up some of the lost revenue.  Moreover, judging by the spike this past December, I’d hazard a guess that either year-end budgets were looking tight or that goals or quotas had been set at the beginning of the year and were not being met.</p>

<h2 id="what-locations-are-they-targeting">What locations are they targeting?</h2>

<p>Between January 20, 2013 and January 20, 2015, citations were issued at 38,597 unique locations.  <strong>1.2% of those locations account for 45.8% of the total value of fines issued.</strong>  What were the target locations?  Here are the top 20 locations in terms of total fines issued.</p>

<h3 id="university-of-baltimore">University of Baltimore</h3>

<p>I would post a map, but I haven’t been able to confirm that “U/B” is University of Baltimore, especially since some of the street names aren’t near the university.  University students are prime candidates for parking tickets though, so it does make sense that so many citations are issued there.</p>

<h3 id="block-of-n-charles-st">1200 Block of N. Charles St.</h3>

<p>The 1200 block of N. Charles St. just happens to be the block I live on.  As soon as I discovered that, I had an inkling as to the reason why this would be the case and the data back this up.  This road turns into a major thoroughfare for commuters driving north out of downtown to head back to the ‘burbs, and as far as Charles St. goes this block is probably the block on which cars are most likely to be stopped and blocking traffic due to the number of businesses and close proximity of University of Baltimore.</p>

<p>There’s a Starbucks on one corner with a Chipotle next to it, immediately in front of which there is a bus stop.  In addition to the Starbucks and Chipotle, there are a number of other businesses (frozen yogurt, licquor store, other restaurants) that presumably all take deliveries at regular intervals.  On numerous occasions I’ve walked past and a large truck or semi is parked at the bus stop with a ticket on its windshield.  This would explain at least the “In Transit Zone/Stop,” but I do wonder at how consistent parking police are in their coding of citations.</p>

<p>Street parking immediately behind the bus stop shown below is prohibited weekdays between 4pm and 6pm, which the data show is another large revenue generator.   </p>

<p>It’s interesting that such a large number of fines are coded as “No Stopping/Parking Stadium Event Cambden”  since Cambden Yards isn’t nearby or even on Charles St.  Again, makes me wonder at how the parking police are trained to code the infractions.</p>

    <p>Within hours of publishing my last post on <a href="http://localhost:4000/articles/Baltimores-Lost-Traffic-Camera-Revenue/">Baltimore’s parking (etc.) citation dataset</a>, the issues were corrected thanks to Sharon Paley at <a href="http://www.hackbaltimore.org">Hack Baltimore</a> and Heather Hudson, Baltimore’s Chief Data Officer in the <a href="http://moit.baltimorecity.gov/Home.aspx">Mayor’s Office of Information Technology</a>.</p>

<p>Sharon was kind enough to forward my work on to Heather, who removed old and extraneous data and added some description to some of the citation data fields.  With Heather’s permission I’ve excerpted her email below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The dataset should, and now does, reflect 2 rolling years of citations and any older citations that still have an outstanding balance. The data was not being updated and purged consistently, resulting in older citations still appearing. These older citation records were likely not updated properly (balance, penalty, etc), so have now been purged from the dataset.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reason for the 2 year  limited time frame of the dataset is that the Parking Citations system is housed on a mainframe, which has storage limitations. We are also forced to re-use citation numbers, which necessitates purging of older citation records.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks to your article, I have added a more informative description of the dataset, as well as short descriptions of the currency columns you mentioned. I hope that this helps users better understand the data presented.</p>

<p>I exported another csv file the evening of January 21 that resulted in 1,004,288 rows (compared to about 2.7 million rows previously, meaning <strong>63% of the dataset was erroneous and discarded</strong>).  Total fines issued in the whole datset now amount to just over $48 million.  </p>

<h2 id="why-are-there-still-data-in-here-from-before-january-21-2013-2-years-before-the-date-i-downloaded-this-set">Why are there still data in here from before January 21, 2013 (2 years before the date I downloaded this set)?</h2>

<p>Well, you wouldn’t want to remove information about citations that haven’t been paid in full yet.  484,146 records (out of just over 1 million, or about half) are from before 2 years ago because they haven’t been paid in full.  I confirmed that there are zero records for which the import date is more than two years old and does not have an outstanding balance (if going by the violation date, there are 16 records as of Jan. 21, 2015 older than two years with a zero balance in the database).  </p>

<p>What this means is that we effectively have two datasets here: one for accounts with open balances from before the rolling 2 year date and one for all citations (regardless of balance) for the last 2 years rolling.  Lumping them all together wouldn’t yield apples-to-apples comparisons or indicate policy changes properly since we’re missing citation records that have been paid and were issued/imported more than two years ago.  We can however do this with the data for the most recent 2 years.  I suppose the pre-2-years ago data could be considered the “delinquent” batch and data for the most recent 2 years could be called the “full 2 year” batch.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-money-is-owed-to-the-city">How much money is owed to the city?</h2>

<p>This is the kicker.  Looking only at the old citations prior to January 21, 2013?  The outstanding balance is <strong>$102,384,876.00</strong>, and that’s on citations that would have originally been worth only $23,873,386.00.  In other words, for still-open tickets prior to January 21, 2013, the city is owed more than <strong>4 times the value</strong> of the initial citations.  Wonder if the city has a plan of attack for reeling some of this in?  The wages of parking police probably pale in comparsion to the value of these citations, so maybe they see this as free money that they’ll never make the effort to get, having already paid the overhead. Of course there are logistical and legal challenges to enforcing these as well, but this is surely money the city of Baltimore could use.</p>

<p>Thanks again to Sharon at Hack Baltimore and Heather, our city’s Chief Data Officer, for helping to keep our government’s open data clean, current and useful.</p>

    <p>The title of the dataset I’m working with on Baltimore’s <a href="http://data.baltimorecity.gov/">open data portal</a> is “Parking Citations.”  I downloaded a snapshot of the dataset which ended up being 2,689,647 total citations through January 12, 2015. </p>

<p>But parking is not the only thing captured in this set. Traffic camera violations are also here (“Fixed Speed Cameras,” “Mobile Speed Cameras,” and probably some “Red Light Violations” and “Right on Red” citations) which were far and away the city’s largest revenue generator out of all of the infraction types captured here.  The fixed speed cameras alone issued nearly $28 million in citations over a three year period, until the <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/sun-investigates/bs-md-speed-camera-hearing-20141201-story.html">program was ended</a>.  The last two rows appear to be one-off citations.  It’s also curious that the last record of a “Snow Emergency Route Violation” was in August. In Baltimore.</p>

<p>This all isn’t quite syncing up with what the <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/sun-investigates/bs-md-speed-camera-hearing-20141201-story.html">Baltimore Sun reported</a> about the traffic camera program.  According to this article, the traffic camera program generated about $140 million over 10 years.  The data contained in Baltimore’s open data portal must be incomplete, since I’m seeing a total of about $127 million for all violation types, not just cameras.  </p>

<p>To show this a bit more dramatically, here’s the time series of total monthly citations issued for the top 10 revenue generator categories.  It’s pretty clear that the data are incomplete since the traffic camera categories should have dominated for 10 years straight, and we’re seeing no significant records before 2007, even though the earliest start dates shown in the table above show dates typically starting in 2002-2003, with “Red Light Violations” starting in 1999.  Unfortunately, the Baltimore open data portal does not provide a data dictionary or substantive description of what all is contained in the dataset and what each field represents.  For example, in addition to “violFine,” there are “balance,” “openFine,” and “openPenalty” fields which all include “$” signs in the records to indicate currency.  These aren’t defined anywhere.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t say that the lack of definitions and descriptions of the data render them completely useless, but it does make it more difficult to make apples-to-apples comparisons and draw conclusions.</p>

    <p>I find myself importing a slew of comma-separated value (csv) files quite often so I wrote up a quick bit of code to handle it.  </p>

<p>It’s uber-simple - just loops through all the csv’s in a directory, appends them to one Pandas dataframe, and saves the new csv.  It also tacks on the filenames of each file if separating into the original files is needed later.  This also assumes all the fields are named exactly the same in all the csv files.  Sure beats reading each individually and merging after.</p>

    <p>By varying parameters of the <a href="http://localhost:4000/articles/Intro-To-Storage-Model">demand-side storage model</a> we can determine the economic plausibility and benefits of home grid-tied batteries.  </p>

<p>While the actual logic and functions are in separate Python modules, I’m doing this analysis in an <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jtelszasz/demandside_storage/blob/master/analysis.ipynb">iPython notebook</a> that you can check out for more detail and thought process.</p>

<p>I set up some of summary metrics I was interested in in the <a href="http://localhost:4000/articles/Storage-Model-Details">last post</a> .  One that I didn’t have on that list that is an important economic indicator is the simple payback period, which is the number of years it would take to break even on the initial investment based on the yearly savings.</p>

<center>
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?PBP=\frac{Initial%20Investment}{Annual%20Variable%20Cost%20Savings}" alt="PBP=\frac{Initial%20Investment}{Annual%20Variable%20Cost%20Savings}" />
</center>

<p>The summary metrics I’ve calculated should indicate the benefits of having a home battery system to the consumer/household as well as the grid (system operator and grid).  Of course, these are going to be particular to the load profile I’m using (Green Button sample data), but another one-year hourly load profile could easily be supplanted to see how it would work out for other buildings.  </p>

<h2 id="summary-metrics-v-storage-capacity">Summary Metrics v. Storage Capacity</h2>

<p>One question that can be asked of the model is how certain summary metrics vary with the total battery capacity.  For example, an increase in battery size would allow the building to purchase more of the cheaper electricity during off-peak hours increasing the annual savings, but the initial investment also increases.  </p>

<p>All of the other parameters are held constant, with battery and inverter efficiencies during charging and discharging all set to 0.85 (the “inverter_efficiency” and “battery_efficiency” below are function handles).  The charge rate estimate is assuming it take 8 hours to fully charge the battery.  I’ve estimated the cost of deep-discharge lead acid batteries as being about $166 per kilowatt-hour of storage (based on a quick Amazon.com search that dug up $200 for a 1.2 kWh battery).  The model currently isn’t sophisticated enough to vary the charge and discharge rates based on voltage and current as should be done, but this should suffice for a rough estimate.  For an initial estimate, I also have not factored in battery replacement to the payback period, though this should have a substantial effect and I’ll need to do this at some point.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jtelszasz/demandside_storage/blob/master/analysis.ipynb">analysis notebook</a> I create an array with all of the battery sizes, and loop through them each time setting the bat_size variable to the next size in the array.  Each time, the model creates the output over the entire year (all 8,760 hours) and then calculates the summary metrics.  The result is a dataframe of all the summary metrics indexed by summary size.</p>

</center>

<p>Now it’s easy to create some plots to illustrate how these metrics change with storage capacity.</p>

<h3 id="cost-savings-and-payback-period">Cost Savings and Payback Period</h3>

<p>The expectation is that there are diminishing returns, since there is a limited number of peak hours energy demand that can be supplied by electricity purchased during off-peak hours, while of course the amount of battery storage we can purchase is unlimited.  Based on this plot, the most storage we should purchase is 15 kWh worth.  The percent savings calculated is with respect to the default static BGE residential electricity prices, in other words what this home would have paid over the course of the year in electricity supplied (not including fixed tariffs and charges).</p>

  <figcaption>Annual cost savings for demand-side storage (home battery) system.</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

<p>In general, the payback periods are a bit longer than I thought they would be.  There’s a clear optimum solution at a storage capacity of 5 kWh with the payback period being about 14.5 years.  What’s really driving the cost effectiveness (I think) is the difference between the peak and off-peak cost of electricity.  A wider difference between these prices will make it more cost effective to purchase storage and electricity during off-peak hours.</p>

  <figcaption>Simple payback period for demand-side storage (home battery) system.</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

<h3 id="grid-benefits-load-shaving">Grid Benefits (Load Shaving)</h3>

<p>This pretty closely mirrors the cost savings, and understandably so since the costs are directly proportional to the amount of electricity being removed from peak-hours and purchased instead during off-peak hours.  At 15 kWh of storage we’ve just about maxed out the amount of peak time kilowatt-hours we can shave, which is all off the electricity demand for this house occuring during peak hours.  This is about 1800 kWh for this house’s load profile.</p>

  <figcaption>Peak load shaving for demand-side storage (home battery) system.</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

<h3 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h3>

<p>Since electricity purchased simultanesously with demand (not shifted using storage) doesn’t go through any other equipment, the system’s efficiency is effectively 100% since all the electricity purchased goes directly to the serve the demand.  However, electricity purchased during off-peak hours for use at a later time first goes through the inverter to become DC, then is stored in the battery (also lossy), and takes the opposite process on the way out.  That means that the quantity of kilowatt-hours purchased from the grid becomes higher as more electricity is bought and stored.  For this reason, the “efficiency” (the total annual kWh demand divided by the total kWh purchased from the grid) drops as storage size increases. </p>

  <a href="http://localhost:4000/images/2014-11/sys_eff_stor_cap.png"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/2014-11/sys_eff_stor_cap.png" /></a>
  <figcaption>Total kWh purchased during year for demand-side storage (home battery) system.</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

<p>This is an important (albeit predictable) result since it means we’ve effectively increased the carbon footprint of the home, assuming the electricity mix is dominated by carbon-intensive power sources.  What such a system could allow for, however, is that intermittent renewable resources could more readily integrate with storage acting as a buffer between demand and intermittent supply.</p>

The 6am/7am peak is pretty clear, as are the evening hours in the summer.  Between midnight a 4am, the usage is clearly higher (deeper yellow) in the summer as well due to AC load.</p>

    <p>This post fills in some more details of the <a href="http://localhost:4000/articles/Intro-To-Storage-Model">demand-side storage model</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve illustrated the switch as being a separate component so we can see that electricity could bypass actually being inverted and stored (electricity from the grid sometimes goes directly to the demand).  In reality, the inverter/switch/charge controller would be one system.  This unit and the batteries would be the initial costs for the system.</p>

<h2 id="model-parameters">Model Parameters</h2>

<p>For electricity going straight to serve demand (not being stored first), there are essentially no additonal losses.  However, batteries only accept DC electricity, so we need an inverter to turn the AC off the grid to DC and back.  There are losses associated with this conversion, and the batteries themselves are lossy.  For now I’ve set these efficiencies as constants, but implemented them in functions so they could in the future get more sophisticated modeling (charging efficiency for batteries is dependent on depth of charge).  The nominal efficiency values are taken from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Renewable-Efficient-Electric-Power-Systems/dp/0471280607/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412769771&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=renewable+and+efficient+electric+power+systems">Renewable and Efficient Electric Power Systems by Gilbert Masters</a>.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>Once the model has calculated all the energy flows for each hour over the course of the year, I calculate a set of key properties of the system behavior.  These results are shown in the table below.  These are the characteristics I’ll be interested in as the system parameters described above are varied (though I may modify this set).</p>

<ul>
  <li>’% Peak Demand Battery’: Percent of the total peak demand over the year served from the battery</li>
  <li>’% Peak kWh Shaved’: Percent of the total demand during peak hours removed from the grid</li>
  <li>’% Purchased During Off-Peak’: Percent of annual electricity purchased during off-peak hours</li>
  <li>’% Purchased During Peak’: Percent of annual electricity purchased during peak hours</li>
  <li>‘Annual System Eff’: Total annual demand divided by total annual electricity purchased</li>
  <li>‘Annual Var Cost’: Annual electricity cost</li>
  <li>‘Hours Battery Depleted’: Number of hours in the year that battery is drained to maximum depth of discharge</li>
  <li>‘Hours Battery Full’: Number of hours in the year that battery is fully charged</li>
  <li>‘Hours on Battery Only’: Number of hours in the year that demand is served by battery alone</li>
  <li>‘Initial Cost’: Initial system cost (inverter + batteries)</li>
  <li>‘Peak kWh Shaved’: Total electricity during peak hours removed from the grid</li>
  <li>‘Total kWh Purchased’: Total annual electricity purchased</li>
</ul>

<p>Below are some initial values from the simulation with a storage size of 9 kWh.</p>

<p>For these initial values, what stood out to me was that I removed 54% of the residence’s annual peak demand from the grid (this is the ‘% Peak kWh Shaved’).  This is the reason utilities might want to think about incentivizing residential customers to purchase grid-tied battery systems such as this (beyond just the time-of-use-pricing incentive itself).  I should say that the current model is agnostic to exactly which peak hours load is being shaved from - it just uses the battery first until it’s depleted and then switches to grid during peak hours.  Utilities would want to be a bit more sensitive to this, since their peak time-of-use currently starts at 10am weekdays in the summer but the actual “peak” won’t hit until around 4pm.  In the current model I’ve created, the battery is used up first so I wouldn’t be shaving peak load at 4pm.  This could be addressed with some logic that is a bit more clever than what I’ve currently got.</p>
