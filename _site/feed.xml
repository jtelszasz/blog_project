&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;!-- /#table-of-contents --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citizens of Baltimore and captive customers of Baltimore Gas &amp;amp; Electric! In the words of Gabriel, I bring you good tidings of great joy and data and stuff. For the last year or so BGE has been rolling out smart meters to their electricity customers. Our neighborhood was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bge.com/smartenergy/smartgrid/smartmeters/Pages/Installation-Schedule.aspx&quot;&gt;slated for the second half of last year&lt;/a&gt;, and lo, our data hath appeared unto us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BGE indicates that the smart meter upgrades have two components - electricity meter replacement (which communicates every 4 hours) and an upgrade to the natural gas meter that also enables communication (though this only happens every 24 hours). Currently, my BGE dashboard is only showing my electricity consumption so most of the discussion below only applies to electricity. I’ve read their website extensively but have found no indication that we’ll also get to see hourly gas consumption. This is unfortunate for single family home owners who burn natural gas on site for space heating, since this is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=10271&amp;amp;src=%E2%80%B9%20Consumption%20%20%20%20%20%20Residential%20Energy%20Consumption%20Survey%20(RECS)-b1&quot;&gt;largest portion of their annual energy consumption&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears there are two primary functions the smart meters will initially serve: for providing information to their customers and to monitor the grid for outages. (Apparently even just partial implementation proved their case for grid outage notification during &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/bge-gets-a-taste-of-smart-meter-capabilities-during-sandy&quot;&gt;Hurricane Sandy&lt;/a&gt;.) These are two pretty straight-forward applications of the data, I’m wondering where BGE (and other utilities) is headed for the next-step analysis (predictive analytics, grid efficiency and repair, optimization, renewables and storage integration, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting note on the BGE data privacy policy and a bit of wishful thinking: while BGE can’t disclose or sell individual customer interval data, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bge.com/smartenergy/smartgrid/Pages/Data-Privacy-Policy.aspx&quot;&gt;BGE website&lt;/a&gt; states “Smart Meter interval energy use data that is not specific to the customer, such as combined data, is not included within the scope of this policy.” I think BGE could get ahead of the curve by providing block (or similar aggregate) data in the name of transparency and perhaps as a community service. As they indicate, aggregate data is not covered by the data privacy policy; moreover, the City of Baltimore has followed the suit of many other major cities by establishing an &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.baltimorecity.gov&quot;&gt;open data repository.&lt;/a&gt; Perhaps BGE and the city could work together to post aggregated interval data to Open Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;comparisons-to-neighbors&quot;&gt;Comparisons to Neighbors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BGE website does slightly more than just show you historical use, with the most prominent feature being the ability to compare your use to a sample of comparable neighbors. There have been many studies regarding energy consumption reductions as a result of real-time monitoring, feedback, and contextual comparisons (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.eere.energy.gov/seeaction/pdfs/customerinformation_behavioral_status_summary.pdf &quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). In fact, a couple friends and a former professor did &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778813003782&quot;&gt;some work&lt;/a&gt; on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In keeping with the data policy exclusion for aggregate data, they use an average of a hundred or so customers that share your characteristics, all within a two or three mile radius of your house (ours average 0.4 miles from us). The initial comparison with which I was presented was way off base because our heating comes from electric resistance, but once I answered a few questions on the website about what appliances we have and the like, the comparison made much more sense (I presume we’re being compared against neighbors who all have electric resistance heating).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://jtelszasz.github.io/blog_project/images/BGE-dashboard-01.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jtelszasz.github.io/blog_project/images/BGE-dashboard-01.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the comparisons of your monthly energy use could have been done with the monthly billing they would have anyways, without the use of smart meters. Using the smart meter data, it looks like soon we’ll be able to compare hour-to-hour use (lending what I would presume will be a more real-time competition feel to things) but this isn’t operational yet. They are, however, displaying the hourly data along with the outdoor dry-bulb temperature for reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Hourly electricity consumption (kilowatt-hours) and outdoor temperature (degrees Fahrenheit) for March 11, 2014. (source: www.bge.com)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My roommate was home this day. The drop in consumption in the afternoon could be from her leaving the house and shutting off lights and her computer, the weather, or both.  Later I’ll be looking into our apartment’s response to the weather so it might become a bit more apparent then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disaggregation-and-savings-suggestions&quot;&gt;Disaggregation and Savings Suggestions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another feature they provide is an estimated breakdown of your electricity consumption into categories (heating, lighting, etc.) Currently, these would have to be static estimates based solely on the answers I provided about our appliances and the like. Farther down the road, the hourly data will have a larger role to play here. Electricity consumption (and energy use in general) is largely a function of two things: the weather and human behavior, both of which can change drastically hour to hour. They’ll likely need about a year’s worth of data to be able to tease out the portion of energy use that is your behavior and the portion that is your building’s response to weather. This is because whatever algorithm they are using to disaggregate weather from behavior will need to have seen your electricity consumption during all climates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://jtelszasz.github.io/blog_project/images/BGE-dashboard-06.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jtelszasz.github.io/blog_project/images/BGE-dashboard-06.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Estimated breakdown of electricity consumption based on customer and building characteristics. Also shown, suggestions for reducing usage. (source: www.bge.com)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disaggregation lends itself to targeted recommendations for how to reduce your electricity consumption. An interesting feature they’ve implemented for more social context is a counter of how many customers have indicated that they would try a particular recommendation (eg. “13,859 people will turn off their lights when not needed; 1,654 people will hang dry their laundry,” etc.) In the same way that “like”-ing a post on Facebook along with many others is in some way a validation that one likes the “right” things, I can see this feature serving to validate one’s choices about their energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, this is a good thing. Concerns about radio frequency exposure are rather &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epri.com/abstracts/Pages/ProductAbstract.aspx?ProductId=000000000001021829&quot;&gt;unfounded&lt;/a&gt; especially when we all carry cell phones in our pockets. If you are someone who has concerns about data privacy, nothing I have to say on the topic will likely alleviate your fears (particularly in light of the fact that I’m posting my energy usage data on a blog). In a later post, I’ll show you more about my data (in the hopes that you show me yours).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#crosses&quot;&gt;Crosses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;!-- /#table-of-contents --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Manchester City FC and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.optasports.com&quot; title=&quot;Opta&quot;&gt;Opta&lt;/a&gt; (a sports analytics company) teamed up to release a season’s worth of granular data for the 2011-2012 season. Two datasets were released - one with 206 fields containing total game events by player, and another that included x-y locations for passes and shots for each player for the Bolton-Manchester City match on August 21, 2011. There are plenty of other blogs that have been doing football analytics and looking at this data, and I’m likely not to break any new ground. I thought it would be a fun dataset to look at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I’m a goalkeeper, I became interested in measuring the performance of goalkeepers. Having surveyed a number of soccer analytics blogs, goalkeeping seems to be a lesser researched topic and is also potentially more difficult to analyze given the smaller number of events or actions a goalkeeper might take over the course of a game compared to field players. I shouldn’t suggest here that I’ll be breaking new ground or providing revolutionary keeper analysis - I’m no statistics whiz - just letting you on to my motivations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To kick things off (ugh, I can’t possibly get away with that), I’ve provided some quick and hopefully useful stat tables for the overall season numbers for goalkeepers. I’m only looking at goalkeepers who played 1080 minutes or more (12 games) so we have a reasonable sample size for each goalkeeper. I’ll get to some potential visualizations later, but for now these stats are simple enough that ordered lists are a clear enough way to see some performance metrics. I’m actively choosing not to go the bar graph route; I think they’re terrible for three or more variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would also be a good time to mention the “P90” measures. Since not all players have played the same minutes, it makes sense to normalize their actions to their time played.  Instead of per minute (as in saves per minute or distributions per minute) I think it makes sense to do this on a per 90 minute basis.  Ted Knutson (among others) have done this over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.statsbomb.com&quot; title=&quot;Statsbomb&quot;&gt;Statsbomb&lt;/a&gt; (which, if anything I’m talking about is interesting to you, you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to check out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;saves&quot;&gt;Saves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://jtelszasz.github.io/blog_project/images/Saves_Table.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jtelszasz.github.io/blog_project/images/Saves_Table.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Goalkeeper saves tables, 2011-2012 season .&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplest way of measuring keeper performance is just to rate them on save percentage (number of shots saved out of number of conceded shots on target). The dataset is also kind enough to us in that they provide short range saves/shots conceded and long range saves/shots conceded. This starts to drill down a bit more into the qualities of the goalkeeper. This is especially true of short range.  For long range shots in the Premier League it should take a true screamer to beat a goalkeeper, so these numbers &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; all be at or near 100%, and are likely more reflective of the number of long-range blinders the team conceded than the keeper’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the looks of it, de Gea is a top shot-stopper. I’ll discuss him a bit with regard to crosses as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Szczesny was apparently not very good for Arsenal this season. All three save percentages (all, long-range, and short-range) are near bottom. Granted, these numbers don’t tell the whole story. Maybe Szczesny was seeing an abnormally high number of quality, well-placed shots at all ranges. A bit of foreshadowing here: we’ll need to look at team defensive performance and shots data to get a better feel for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also see the performance of Mignolet and Begovic starting to stand out. Both were with bottom half of the table teams and were likely facing many more decent chances than a Hart or a De Gea. Of course, Mignolet is now Liverpool’s starter and Belgium’s number two, and Begovic (despite a howler or two and a current injury) is highly touted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;distribution&quot;&gt;Distribution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://jtelszasz.github.io/blog_project/images/Dist_Table.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jtelszasz.github.io/blog_project/images/Dist_Table.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Goalkeeper distribution tables, 2011-2012 season.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in all of these top level stats, the distribution numbers are confounded as well. I think team tactics has a pretty big role to play here. For a possession team, a goalkeeper is going to be picking out short balls and throws and trying to keep his numbers up. Other more direct or counter-attacking sides will want a goalkeeper to quickly get long balls down the field or to the flanks, possibly with lesser rates of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely want to do some more work on distribution. You won’t get through a televised broadcast of a Premier League match without a former (field) player (probably Eric I-Need-Salsa-For-The-Big-Ass-Chip-On-My-God-Damn-Shoulder Wynalda or Robbie Mustoe) decrying the need for the &lt;em&gt;modern&lt;/em&gt; goalkeeper to be comfortable on the ball - to assist a team in maintaining possession, meaning make simple passes to nearby defenders while under pressure. Besides just these distribution numbers (which are for distibution after a keeper catches), passing numbers should play a heavy role in determining the ability of a goalkeeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;crosses&quot;&gt;Crosses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://jtelszasz.github.io/blog_project/images/Cross_Table.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jtelszasz.github.io/blog_project/images/Cross_Table.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Goalkeeper distribution tables, 2011-2012 season.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De Gea and Reina quite clearly prefer punching or not challenging for the ball at all to catching. De Gea got quite a bit of flack in this, his first season in the Premier League. From a goalkeeper’s prospective, I’d be flaky as all get out on crosses if I started in the Premier League at 23 (granted he was a product of the Atletico Madrid youth academy and was first choice for the first team for about a season and a half there). It’s much easier to build confidence on shot-stopping (especially when you are as good and as agile as de Gea) but it’s hard to duplicate high pressure, game-like cross scenarios in training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What these numbers don’t tell you is whether a punch was successful in clearing the ball out of danger or not. (For that we’d need to dig pretty deeply into X-Y coordinate data from another dataset.) Obviously if a keeper punches but the ball slips out to an opposing player for a shot, the keeper hasn’t really effectively dealt with the cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All else being equal, I can’t imagine Liverpool and Manchester United were allowing any more dangerous crosses into their box than any other team (which might lead to more punches from the keeper), so I think it’s generally a bad thing that both of these keepers were preferring to punch so often. Of course it was De Gea’s first season at United, and Reina is no longer with Liverpool, so I guess there you have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, hope some of these numbers are fun or useful to you. I’m definitely having fun digging into this dataset. &lt;/p&gt;
